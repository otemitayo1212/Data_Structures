    Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook.
    (Actor, director, producer, writer, born July 9, 1956 in Concord, California).

When Reader's Digest did a poll in 2013 to find out who are the 100 Most Trusted People in America, Tom Hanks came out as No. 1. It's no surprise that the much-beloved star of such hits as Big, Forrest Gump, Castaway, and Toy Story is one of the most powerful and well-respected actors in Hollywood. His accessibility and charisma have earned him comparisons with such screen legends as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. Tom Hanks is the "everyman" whose portrayals make us reconsider our own moral choices. Watching him on screen, we think about what we would do--and have done. "And that's why we all love you so much," said Oprah in a 2001 interview with Hanks. "We recognize ourselves in your characters."

Last week, Jamie Lee Curtis sparked “internet feud” headlines when she gleefully declared on social media that her new film “out marvels any Marvel movie”. The multiverse-themed Everything Everywhere All at Once has indeed been giving Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (which cost eight times as much) a run for its money, both financially and artistically. Punching way above its weight, this inventive indie pic boasts spectacular ambitions that belie its limited budget. Yet for all its madcap invention and frenzied visual wit, what drives this story of a woman trapped in a world of “laundry and taxes” is a tangible emotional wallop – that most “special” effect that franchise blockbusters so often fail to deliver.

Michelle Yeoh sinks her teeth into a kaleidoscopic role that cheekily draws on her own genre-hopping back catalogue. She plays Evelyn Wang, a disillusioned and exhausted Chinese American woman who runs a laundromat with her smilingly disappointing husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, who first rose to fame as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). Together, they are trying to fend off IRS auditor Deirdre Beaubeirdra, played with a jobsworth sneer and a frightening fringe by Jamie Lee Curtis.
