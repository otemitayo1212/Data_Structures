Not only does this make many of the movie's stunts and his physical performance all that more special, but comparing it to the original movie makes it truly shocking.
    Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is another showcase for Tom Cruise's incredible action movie star qualities, but the movie also acts as a shocking reminder of the franchise's longevity thanks to his age. The seventh entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise arrived 27 years after the original movie that rebooted the TV series as an action/thriller movie series. Audiences have spent nearly three decades watching Tom Cruise becoming increasingly more daring with his stunts in an effort to bring more people to theaters and treat them to something they've never seen. It's only become more impressive as he gets older too.

 Boston Celtics rookie Jordan Walsh is already working toward earning the trust of his teammates weeks ahead of the 2023-24 season.

When Walsh was selected 38th overall in this summer’s NBA draft, the Celtics envisioned Walsh’s greatest asset translating from Arkansas to Boston: Defense, something the C’s desperately need.

Since the Celtics have a questionable reserve unit tasked with supporting a star-studded core, Walsh has the perfect opportunity to grow as a household name in Boston, and so far, so good for the 19-year-old.

Most Memorable Seasons of Keeping up With the Kardashians.
Keeping up With The Kardashians entertained fans of the famous family for 20 seasons, before ultimately ending its run in 2021. Viewers watched for 14 years as Kris Jenner helped her six children become international icons, but some were more successful than others. Kim Kardashian has always been the biggest name for the family, although Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian became better known through the show.

In later years of the series, Kris’ younger daughters Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner began to rise to fame as well, along with their father, Caitlyn Jenner. Throughout the years, the Kardashian/Jenner family has gone through many ups and downs. While every season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians had its moments, some were far more memorable than others.
Season 12 was one of the most dramatic seasons of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which of course makes it one of the most memorable! This was the season where Rob hard launched his relationship with model Blac Chyna. As many know, Blac Chyna previously dated Tyga, who dated Kylie shortly before Rob and Blac Chyna were an item. This was definitely the main storyline of Season 12, as the family was understandably shocked by the news.

This was not the only relationship-related drama from Season 12. Khloe struggled with maintaining a relationship with her ex-husband Lamar Odom as well. Furthermore, Scott Disick decided that his break-up with Kourtney did not mean he could not still be close with the rest of the family. That obviously caused controversy.
