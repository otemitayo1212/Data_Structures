Sweet, tangy tomatoes are delicious in all sorts of savoury dishes.

The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America. The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derives.

Rotten Tomatoes, home of the Tomatometer, is the most trusted measurement of quality for Movies & TV.

Tomato, flowering plant of the nightshade family, cultivated extensively for its edible fruits. Rotten Tomatoes is an American review-aggregation website for film and television. The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang.

WHY DID WE ALL LOVE JESSE PINKMAN?

It's 3am and so many thoughts run through my mind, but one I can’t push out is how Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking Bad, managed to make Jesse Pinkman such a likable character despite everything he did. It’s been 4 years since I watched Breaking Bad and 10 years since the last episode of the AMC original aired, and I still talk about it with my friends.

Aaron Paul played Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad
However, Jesse still manages to be beloved. I, for one, was rooting for him for most of the show. And the very first thing that draws anyone to him is vulnerability. And this vulnerability is even more prominent because it’s juxtaposed with the ever-growing Ego of Walter White. Even when Jesse was high beyond the clouds and was on the brink of collapsing their business, he did it with this sense of lack of control that made you want to jump onto the screen and help him. When he pulls the trigger into an adversary’s face, he does so with tears in his eyes and fear, so much so that you want to hug him and assure him it’s okay. The creator gave Jesse something that was a universally accepted way of wooing one’s way into people’s hearts: just being vulnerable.

Jesse had a story. His parents weren’t the most supportive; he didn’t do well in school either, but he was shown to be trying. He wanted to be better. He wanted to stop cooking meth once he had made enough money. He wanted a life, a family with friends. Jesse knew when to stop. So, when such a sore wound is shown as against Walter White's incessant need to keep growing bigger, the audience gravitates towards the relatable.

Some have argued on the show's reddit community that he was manipulated by Walter White but It may not be far-fetched to consider Jesse as one of the villains of Breaking Bad. I believe the writers wanted us to. Regardless, he’s in a pool of much more ruthless villains, sometimes being a victim himself of their harsh ways, that his status as a villain from the start quickly disappears before our eyes. Jesse’s switch from bad guy meth dealer to I want to get out of this life, but I can’t, garners him sympathy because, somehow, we would all have loved a good comeback story. A bad guy that realizes his ways and wants to turn but is in too deep, oh! How helpless.

Jesse's welfare became so important to the fanbase that a movie, El Camino, had to be made to give him the good life he “deserved.” But I ask myself, even after all this, was Jessie inherently good or bad, and why did we all love him so much?

How Skyler White Became Unpopular in the Breaking Bad Fandom?

Fans of Breaking Bad viewed Bryan Cranston's protagonist, Walter White, as the everyman who made it "big." They applauded his meteoric rise from an ill-fated loser to a powerful drug lord who may have influenced The Book of Boba Fett. The critically acclaimed AMC drama was rife with characters very much like Walt; although they possessed obvious flaws — and committed innumerable misdeeds — their positive qualities and complexities kept viewers coming back (and then following them to spinoff Better Call Saul).

Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) was beloved for his good heart and quirky personality despite aiding Walt in his meth-making endeavors. Walt's brother-in-law, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), a racist DEA agent who often abused his power, was nevertheless predominantly viewed as a righteous and self-sacrificing family man on the side of the angels. A notable exception was Walt's wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn). While crushed beneath the weight of Walt's criminal activities and desperate to protect their children, Skyler was widely seen as a massive hypocrite by Breaking Bad fans, who treated the character with a shocking amount of malice.

Updated Joshua M. Patton on December 15, 2023: The series created by Vince Gilligan as one of the earliest original offerings from AMC was full of despicable villains. However, Skyler White received more fan derision than many of the murderers and scoundrels who populated the series. The reaction is a phenomenon that baffled Gilligan and Gunn. Of all the characters who were villainous in the series, Skyler wasn't one of them. There are a number of reasons why fans reacted the way they did, some of them entirely predictable. So, why did Skyler White catch so much hate from fans of Breaking Bad?

Cranston's performance as Walter was truly groundbreaking, making audiences fall in love with a character who seemed like a good man but was, as the title said, breaking bad. The writers may have been a little too effective at making Walter empathetic. Even though he loved Skyler more than anyone else, except maybe Walter, Jr., fans saw her as disloyal. In reality, she was a decent person caught in an impossible situation. How far she went to help Walter showed she was loyal, almost to a fault. Yet, that's not the way the most passionate Breaking Bad fans saw it.

Fan forums were flooded with hateful comments that tore apart Breaking Bad's Skyler for everything from minor transgressions to her openly pleading with Walter to get out of the drug game. It went too far when they turned to actress Anna Gunn's appearance. From the onset of Breaking Bad, viewers saw Skyler as someone who put down her husband. When Walt arrived late to his own birthday party, she berated him for it. She seemed too focused on a trivial online auction to provide him with any real intimacy. She even "nagged" him about obtaining money for his presumed terminal cancer. This is all typical behavior for long-married couples, and she didn't know anything about Walter's secret life.

Still, Skyler was quickly characterized as the antithesis of the "supportive housewife" archetype, which placed her in an adversarial role before the start of any real conflict. Her strong personality and clearly illustrated desires clashed with Walt's meek and listless demeanor in the early seasons, despite her husband lying to her constantly. When Walt later asserted himself as a drug kingpin, Skyler's helplessness to protect her family was viewed as yet another attempt to prevent her husband from thriving. The audience wasn't meant to be rooting for Walt, but they did just the same.

Skyler Embraced Her Darker Side and Was Called a Hypocrite

When efforts to distance herself from Walt proved fruitless, Skyler was seduced by the money and developed something akin to Stockholm Syndrome. That led many Skyler critics to dub her a hypocrite. To some, Walter White remains among the most celebrated antiheroes in pop culture. And that left his wife — as Gunn noted in a New York Times article — relegated to the role of "a drag, a shrew." To a number of viewers, Skyler was a whining, spoiled, and perpetually unhappy woman worthy of their vitriol. Where Walt plays into the gendered stereotype of the ideal American male — a ruthless provider — the strong-minded Skyler refuses to partake in the docile role apparently dictated by her gender.

Despite that, much to the outrage of fans, she was frequently shown partaking in frivolous "feminine" practices, such as bathing, applying lotion, and taking pride in her appearance, all while lecturing her "hard-working" husband. Skyler was lied to, manipulated, attacked, and abused over the course of Breaking Bad's five seasons. Yet, Walt is viewed as the victim of his wife's domineering nature. As YouTube essayist Jack Saint noted, that is illustrated most clearly in Season 3, Episode 3, "I.F.T." The episode placed an unusual focus on Skyler, who had attempted to remove Walt from the family home.

Walt broke in and — in front of the police — cradled their daughter, Holly, admitted to his shortcomings, and shared his regrets about not being "the most attentive father." Audiences, fully conditioned to empathize with Walt, took his words as truthful. They fully believed Walt's ongoing charade as a loving and selfless family man. They, like the officers, were being lied to. Skyler was living in abject terror with every new revelation about how dark his life had gotten. Walt was an obvious danger to Skyler and their children. However, every effort to protect her children was met with, at best, indifference and, at worst, further sympathy for her tormenter. Contextualized any other way, this scenario wouldn't be out of place in a horror film.

Breaking Bad's End Marked the Start of Skyler's Redemption

Although the sheer amount of hatred for Skyler hasn't completely disappeared since the end of Breaking Bad, most viewers re-examined their viewpoint as Walt became more and more irredeemable. Season 5, Episode 14, "Ozymandias" saw Walt kidnap his daughter. His associates had just killed Hank, and he wanted them to flee with him. But Skyler, along with Walter, Jr., refused. The scene in which Skyler fell to her knees in the middle of the street, pleading for Holly's return, woke many up to the fact she was as much a victim of her husband as anyone. The episode finally allowed viewers to see the truth behind Walt's actions.

Breaking Bad was never a story about a poor, tyrannical man attaining great — if unlawful — success. It was a story about one pathetic, self-pitying man's slow downward spiral into undeniable evil. Unfortunately for Skyler and the actress who played her, many fans realized that far too late. Gilligan admitted the show was "rigged" against her in an interview with The New Yorker because of how Cranston's performance humanized Walt. However, he also couldn't deny the role sexism played in the hate the character and, even more so, Gunn herself received. Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) was Walter's nemesis, and he "didn't suffer the animosity Skyler received. It's a weird thing. I'm still thinking about it all these years later," Gilligan said.

The most vocal viewers forgave the men for almost any transgression, but Skyler was treated harshly for behaving like any decent person would in such an impossible situation. Over the course of his downward spiral into villainy, Skyler was meant to be a character of moral conscience, and fans punished her for it. At worst, she was a spouse who initially took her husband for granted. When she discovered the truth, she tried to support him in her own way. When everything fell apart, her life was also ruined. Breaking Bad doesn't have any heroes, but it's full of victims, including Skyler White.
