	"They give great notes. They're really good," Reba praised. "They're knowledgeable about the business but they also have a lot of heart and that's what they're going for."

Dan + Shay say they've been fans of the show for years -- they served as mentors for Blake Shelton's team back in season 20 and even stepped in to guest coach Niall Horan's team last season -- but getting to serve as full-time coaches for the first time has been a whole new experience.

"It's changed everything for us," Shay admitted. "I just really enjoy the process of getting to work with these artists, and you really, you get attached. It becomes heartbreaking when you have to let people go. But it's been an amazing experience."

Chance the Rapper makes his return this season for the first time since his season 23 Voice debut, where he joined Blake, Niall and Kelly Clarkson. He told ET that it's especially exciting to be back with a whole new roster of coaching talent.

"I've always just admired John and he's helped me in so many different ways," he reflected. "To be working with him and then to be around Reba, and Dan + Shay, and with this amazing crew... I do miss Blake, but it's just cool to be back in the building."

Despite the good vibes, however, the coaches are still plenty competitive. With Niall stepping away this season after winning back-to-back titles, the Voice trophy is up for grabs -- and there's a better-than-average chance it could go to a first-time champion, as only John has won the competition before.

"It's getting heated out there for sure," Shay revealed.

"That's why we're here," Reba agreed.

Prison Break is an American serial drama television series created by Paul Scheuring for Fox.
New ‘Prison Break’ Series in the Works at Hulu.
“Prison Break” is getting another sentence, as a new series set in the world of the beloved Fox drama is being developed by Hulu, Variety has confirmed.

“Mayans M.C.” co-creator and showrunner Elgin James is writing the show, which is in early stages of development, via his Sierra Drive banner. The new installment, via 20th Television, is not expected to feature the characters at the center of the original jailhouse drama, Michael Scofield (played by Wentworth Miller) and Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell).

James executive produces alongside Dawn Olmstead, “Prison Break” creator Paul Scheuring, Marty Adelstein and Neal Moritz. In addition to the “Sons of Anarchy” spinoff “Mayans,” James also co-created with Stephen Merchant the Amazon Studios/BBC One series “The Outlaws,” starring Christopher Walken.

“Prison Break” ran for five seasons on Fox and spawned a TV movie, “The Final Break,” and a low-budget spinoff, “Prison Break: Proof of Innocence,” which was exclusively available on mobile phones. The series also inspired a video game, online webisodes, a magazine and a novel.

The original “Prison Break” follows Lincoln Burrows, who has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and his brother Michael Scofield, who hatches a plan to help Lincoln escape from prison. The show was a ratings juggernaut and picked up a Golden Globe for best television series drama for its inaugural season.

The series also starred Robin Tunney, Peter Stormare, Amaury Nolasco, Marshall Allman, Wade Williams and Paul Adelstein. It was executive produced by Adelstein, Moritz, Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Dawn Parouse and Brett Ratner.

Deadline first reported the news.

This weekend, people all over the world will celebrate St. Patrick's Day. While there is no official connection between the holiday and James Harden's latest sneakers - the timing is quite lucky.

Throughout this season, Harden has worn his eighth signature adidas sneaker in various colorways. So far, two colorways have launched and sold out quickly online. Now, the adidas Harden Vol. 8 'Luxury Green' looks to keep the momentum rolling.
Clippers hit the road with questions about Kawhi Leonard and James Harden
Already without Russell Westbrook, the Clippers could be down two more stars due to injuries.
The wheels haven’t come off, but fissures have begun to appear in the health of the two of the players driving the Clippers this season.

Kawhi Leonard and James Harden are experiencing soreness and spasms that could affect their availability over the next few games. Leonard left during the first half of Tuesday night’s game against the Minnesota Timberwolves with thoracic spasms and Harden was treated by a Clippers trainer long after the game.

Coach Tyronn Lue said after the game that he wasn’t sure whether Leonard would accompany the team on its two-game trip to play the Chicago Bulls on Thursday and the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday. The spasms, according to the Clippers, made it difficult for Leonard to sit.

“I hope so,” Lue said, about whether Leonard would make the trip.

Harden said he would have to see how his shoulder felt overnight before determining whether he would make the trip.

Leonard and Harden have been counted on heavily this season and are vital to the Clippers’ playoff hopes. Leonard, who played just 52 games the previous two seasons, has already played in 58 this season.
Kendall Jenner & Devin Booker Seeing Each Other Again, Nothing Official Yet.
Keeping up With the Kardashians premiered on October 14, 2007, in the United States on the E! cable network at 10:30/9:30 pm ET/PT.
Kendall & Kylie Jenner Growing Up Through KUWTK | Seasons 1-18 | Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians was created by Ryan Seacrest and revolved around the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family.
I have loved keeping up with the Kardashians for so many years and watching them each grow in so many ways! Laughing as they (especially Khloe and Scott) team up to play jokes on each another, watching them share new experiences, travel, engage the community, go to the White House, explore mutual curiosities, and so on, has been a fun ride. The series makes you laugh, cry and cringe all at once. It inspires conversation about justice (Kim), wellness (Kourtney), inner strength and empowerment (Khloe), business entrepreneurship (Kylie), independence and creativity (Kendall), and family and tradition (Kris), alongside challenges like addiction, anxiety, robbery, wildfires, divorce, pregnancy complications, gender transitioning, sibling rivalries, business mistakes, bullying and more. At the end of the day, the Kardashians have an incredibly strong family bond that you end up feeling immersed in as a viewer. I admit that I never thought I would enjoy this series based on expectations from the family's media persona. I cringe at the obsessive culture of consumerism they are steeped in -- but the show does have heart. I found myself really enjoying the family bond that's central to the show, and the personal growth of the women.
