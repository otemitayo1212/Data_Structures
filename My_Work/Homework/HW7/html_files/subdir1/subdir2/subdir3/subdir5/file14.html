    Every "Breaking Bad" Dealer Ranked by How Comfortable You'd Be Buying Drugs From Them.
    'Breaking Bad' star Bryan Cranston admits he was 'wanted for murder once' in Florida.
    Although he played a drug dealer on television's "Breaking Bad," actor Bryan Cranston was wanted for a much more nefarious crime back in the 70s.

"I was wanted for murder once," Cranston shared on Jesse Tyler Ferguson's podcast, "Dinner's On Me." He revealed an APB (all-points bulletin) alert was put out for him and his brother by the police, following the murder of their colleague in Daytona Beach, Florida.

Cranston explained how he and his brother were involved, sharing that they "were traveling the country on motorcycles" when they arrived in Florida and "were broke."

"So we had to stop for a while and get jobs because we had to make some money. And we got jobs as waiters in this restaurant called the Hawaiian Inn in Daytona Beach," he said.

"There was this cantankerous chef named Peter Wong, who just hated everyone. There was just no way on earth you were ever going to get on his good side. But he liked the ladies. And so, all the men knew … if we had any problem in the kitchen, we had to send [the ladies] in … He was awful."

The "Malcolm in the Middle" actor said that before the wait staff began their shift each day, they would have meetings to go over logistics. They'd also talk about "how rotten and mean Peter Wong" was.

"And we'd all discuss, if one were to do away with Peter Wong, how would one do it, you know. And some say, 'Well, I think I would use his own wok on him.' You know, ‘I’d put him in the meat grinder.' … We would laugh about all these," Cranston said.

Eventually, he and his brother left Florida, in hopes of reaching Maine. But their story with Wong didn't end there.
"Well, little did we know that right at the time we said goodbye and left the job, Peter Wong went missing. He was not found for a week, week and a half, two weeks," Cranston told Ferguson.

"He was an insecure guy, and what do insecure guys do, they like to feel big, so, he always carried a wad of cash. And he'd go to the dog track," explaining that Wong would ultimately fall into a "honey trap" with a woman.

Wong "went to a house or something, and kaboom! Someone knocked him over the head, took his money. Put his body in the trunk of a car."
Homicide detectives came to Cranston's former place of work, asking questions, and inquiring if there was anyone that had "talk[ed] about hurting or maiming or doing any harm" to the chef.

Cranston, who was not there at the time, says everyone at the meeting admitted to previously joking about Wong's demise, but police pressed more. They asked if there was anyone who had been "joking" in the past that was no longer at the restaurant.
Police were informed about the Cranston brothers and how they'd left town.

"So they're taking out all this information … Little did we know they put out an APB on us and to find us, we were somewhere in the Carolinas, I think at that point. And we didn't know any of this. So we're just tooling along. I can just imagine if someone really pulled us over and down on the ground with a guns blade."

"And then before that came to happen, they put the pieces together and realized … They've had some witnesses and some cameras at the dog track. And they saw what was going on and made an arrest. And so we were this close," he joked of almost being a murder suspect.

A representative for Cranston did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Michelle Yeoh clears up confusing Oscar moment when Emma Stone seemed to ‘ignore’ her
Stone, who won the best actress prize, prompted backlash after many thought she had grabbed the Oscar from Yeoh and ignored her to talk to Jennifer Lawrence.
After the internet was fired up about how best actress Oscar winner Emma Stone seemed to ignore Michelle Yeoh while accepting the award, Yeoh addressed the moment on social media on Monday.

Yeoh, who was among several previous winners of the category to present the award to Stone for her role in “Poor Things,” wrote in an Instagram post that she had unwittingly “confused” the newly crowned winner on stage.

Stone had prompted backlash after many thought she had grabbed the Oscar from Yeoh, ignored her and immediately proceeded to greet Jennifer Lawrence, who was next to Yeoh. Video of the moment shows Yeoh handing the award to Stone and then passing it on to Lawrence, with both of them then congratulating Stone.

“Congratulations Emma!! I confused you, but I wanted to share that glorious moment of handing over Oscar to you together with your best friend Jennifer!!” Yeoh wrote on Instagram, alongside pictures of the three of them on stage. “She reminded me of my Bae Jamie Lee Curtis. Always there for each other!!”

Viewers also called out another situation during the ceremony in which Robert Downey Jr. was accepting the best supporting actor Oscar for his work in “Oppenheimer.” Many thought that Downey failed to acknowledge or make eye contact with last year’s winner Ke Huy Quan, who handed the statuette off to him. It led people across the internet to accuse both Stone and Downey of “unconsciously discriminating” against Asians and behaving disrespectfully toward the martial arts icon.

Neither Stone nor Downey and Quan responded to NBC News’ request for comment.

She used her arm to cover her bare chest and finished the leggy look with black pointed-toe kitten heels adorned with bows. She wore her hair in soft waves and had a full face of glam.

The Hulu personality also included a few blurry photos of herself and her husband, Travis Barker, on a romantic walk while pushing Rocky in a stroller around their neighborhood.
She also posted a snap of her staircase lined with hundreds of roses from the Blink-182 drummer, 48, as well as a snap of 4-month-old Rocky’s hand clutching his dad’s chain necklace.

Fans were left concerned over Kardashian’s photo of an X-ray of a broken arm, though she did not divulge more information about the medical mishap.

Supporters flooded the comments section of the post to gush over the “Kardashians” star’s stylish breast-pumping moment.
“That’s my sister!!!” Khloé Kardashian wrote.

“The glam pump sesh,” a fan commented, adding emojis of clapping hands.

“LOVE the pump picture. Women deserve to be worshipped. Our bodies literally create and grow life and then feed it… with the same body,” a second wrote.
“Pumping and looking amazing! Why not show it off, thank you for normalising [sic] pumping and breastfeeding,” another Instagram user added.

‘Kourtney is a sexy mumma!” one more chimed in.

One hater claimed Kourtney was seeking attention with the snap, writing, “Full make up and heels to show us she uses a breast pump? The things people do for applause.”

“For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, this is a beacon of hope and possibilities,” Yeoh said in her acceptance speech last year. “This is proof that dreams dream big and dreams do come true.”
