How ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ Changed Everything
The reality show shaped not only TV but celebrity, beauty and entrepreneurship.
Keeping Up With The Kardashians Season 13 was another rather memorable one, although not for the happiest of reasons. This season focused on the terrifying incident Kim dealt with on a trip to Paris, in which she was robbed at gunpoint while in her hotel room. While this was a horrible thing, it was rather refreshing to see the show focus on such a serious incident, as opposed to just brushing over it.

While Season 13 was difficult for Kim, it seemed almost harder for Kanye. In the midst of Kim’s trauma from the Paris robbery, Kanye dealt with a downward spiral that landed him in the hospital for nine days. This is hard to forget, as it is when things started to go south in Kim and Kanye’s relationship as well.

Another reason Season 13 was so memorable was because it really put the spotlight on Kendall and Kylie. This season followed Kendall and Kylie as they really began to take modeling more seriously, and even submitted their own fashion line to Vogue for review. This was nice to see, since Kendall and Kylie were often in the shadow of their older sisters during the show’s earlier seasons.
