Adele Performs ‘Million Years Ago’ and ‘Hometown Glory’ on BBC Special: Watch

While the U.S. got to see Adele perform “Hello” and “When We Were Young” on SNL over the weekend, U.K. television viewers were treated to an expanded setlist from the singer on her Nov. 20 Adele at the BBC special with Graham Norton, including 25 album track “Million Years Ago” and her debut single from 19, “Hometown Glory.”

Of “Million Years Ago,” Adele said: “It’s kind of a story about … I drove past Brockwell Park, which is a park in South London I used to live by. It’s where I spent a lot of my youth. It has quite monumental moments of my life that I’ve spent there, and I drove past it and I just literally burst into tears. I really missed it, for no other reason than we’ve all got different things going on and it’s got nothing to do with me not feeling like I can’t go and sit in there and drink a bottle of cider anymore … it’s more that life happens, so I’ve got no one to meet there.”

“That’s basically what it is,” she continued, “And it’s just sort of about that, and about [how] I never realized that this was going to happen. I never, ever realized when I had my guitar in the park, singing to my friends … we never in a million years thought this would ever happen.”

After “Million Years Ago,” she segued into a nostalgic performance of “Hometown Glory,” reminiscing about writing the song that would begin her career.

“This next one was the first song that I ever wrote, when I was about 16,” Adele said. “It’s called ‘Hometown Glory’ and it was all about how I felt about London and stuff like that. I actually wrote it on guitar, and I was at school at the time, and I got my friend at school to transpose onto piano – because I probably could play it, but it’d probably take about 12 hours because I’m such a snail on the piano trying to sing and play at the same time.”

Watch her perform “Million Years Ago” and “Hometown Glory” in the video below.

"Someone like You" is a song recorded by English singer-songwriter Adele. She and Dan Wilson wrote and produced the track for her second studio album

The first pure piano ballad to ever hit #1. It also made the greatest leap to #1 by any song that was already climbing the chart.

Someone Like You Lyrics: I heard that you're settled down / That you found a girl and you're married now / I heard that your dreams came true.

The Story of... 'Someone Like You' by Adele

Adele's 'Someone Like You' is one of the most heartbreaking breakup love songs of all time.

Adele's moving ballad became an international success in 2011, and it's up there as one of the best (if a tad sad) love songs ever written and recorded.

But did you know about its fascinating backstory? Who was the song about? Who wrote it with her?

Adele co-wrote 'Someone Like You' with American singer-songwriter Dan Wilson, who was previously the frontman of the band Semisonic.

The two sat around the piano for two days, and came up with various melodies and lyrics, but ultimately decided to keep the musical production simple.

Wilson said: "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school.

"We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible."

Who is 'Someone Like You' written about?
'Someone Like You' is about a boyfriend who broke up with Adele. The track sums up the now defunct relationship that the album 21 is all about.

Lyrically, the song talks about the end of Adele's first "real relationship" with her long-time friend and lover, and shows her confronting his new marriage.

She later said: "Well, I wrote that song because I was exhausted from being such a b***h, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It'.

"I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him. And when I did it, I felt so freed."

What happened in the real-life relationship?
Adele has said that she began writing the song on her acoustic guitar following the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she assumed she would marry.

A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else.

She explained: "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted. So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever.

"But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free. I didn't think it would resonate with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for."

How did it perform in the charts?
'Someone Like You' was a huge success, topping the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the United States, as well as reaching the top ten in many other countries.

By late 2015, it had sold over 1.5 million copies in the UK alone, making it the second best-selling single of the 2010s and the third-best-seller of the 21st century.

Where was the video filmed?
The music video was filmed in Paris, France, by English director Jake Nava.

The video is in black and white and sees Adele walking along a road and singing the song alone. Eventually, she enters a building in which she sees her ex-lover. After seeing her, he walks away.

It has received over 1 billion views on YouTube.

It transformed her into an international superstar
Her show-stopping performance of the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards helped send it to number one a week later.

With 'Rolling in the Deep' at four, and her first two albums at 4 and 1 respectively, Adele became the first living act to have two top five singles and top five albums in the same week since The Beatles back in 1964.

It wasn't long before she went over to the States and became one of the biggest stars on the planet.

Scientists have studied why it creates such emotional reactions
A Wall Street Journal story revealed that musically, the reaction is due to small, unexpected changes in the melody.

What they call "ornamental notes", appear all over the song, creating a melancholic tension.

Tearjerking ballads often move from soft to loud and contain dramatic shifts at key moments. Here, this is when Adele's voice jumps an octave and becomes much louder in the chorus. Add the heartfelt lyrics, and we're done.
