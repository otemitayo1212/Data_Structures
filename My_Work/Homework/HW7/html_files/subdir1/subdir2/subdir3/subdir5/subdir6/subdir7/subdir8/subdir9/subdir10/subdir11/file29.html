Sweet, tangy tomatoes are delicious in all sorts of savoury dishes.

The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as the tomato plant. The species originated in western South America, Mexico, and Central America. The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derives.

Rotten Tomatoes, home of the Tomatometer, is the most trusted measurement of quality for Movies & TV.
