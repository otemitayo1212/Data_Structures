The coaches are pulling out all the stops to try and win their final team members!
The Voice coaches are pulling out all the stops to try and win their final team members for season 25!

Ronnie Wilson, a 28-year-old South Carolina native, took the stage for Monday's Blind Auditions, with a rendition of Zayn's "Pillowtalk" that impressed the season 25 coaches --  Reba McEntire, John Legend, Chance the Rapper and Dan + Shay -- and earned chair turns from Reba and John.

At first, it seemed like Ronnie and John might have more common ground. Ronnie revealed that he's a full-time accountant. While he's now an EGOT winner, John also worked as a "management consultant" before pursuing music full-time.

However, when Ronnie named gospel and country as his top two musical influences, Reba saw her opportunity.

She cut John off, pretending to lift a phone to her ear.

"Nicole, would you put Keith on the line, please?" she teased, pretending to speak with fellow country star Keith Urban and his wife, Nicole Kidman. "Hey, Keith, how ya doin'? Yeah, we're here at The Voice -- if you were on The Voice, who would you want to coach you? Me? Nicole said her too?"

Unfortunately, Reba's pitch falls just a little bit short, and Ronnie ends up joining Team Legend.
Will injuries destroy the LA Clippers?
The Los Angeles Clippers are set to square off with the Chicago Bulls at 5:00 PM PDT this evening (March 14).

This one is supposed to be a cakewalk. The Bulls are having a mediocre season - and that's putting it generously. Unfortunately, it may not be an easy contest for the Clippers. Russell Westbrook is out with a hand fracture, and Kawhi Leonard and James Harden are both questionable.
Suddenly, a mid-March regular season contest that ought to be a "gimme" could be a challenge. It's been said that availability is the best ability. If the Clippers aren't able to defeat the Bulls this evening, injuries could be the culprit.

Is this likely to be a trend for the Clippers?

LA Clippers are among the most injury-prone teams in the NBA
We know. Injuries are bad. What a remarkable insight! Somebody hand the author a Pulitzer.
