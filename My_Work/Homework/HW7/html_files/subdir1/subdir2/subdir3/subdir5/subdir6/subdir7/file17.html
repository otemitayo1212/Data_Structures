The original cast of Breaking Bad reunited at the 2024 SAG Awards more than 10 years since the original show ended and almost five years since El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie was released.

Bob Odenkirk, RJ Mitte, Anna Gunn, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Jonathan Banks, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris made their way to the stage to present Ensemble in a Drama Series, which their show won in 2014 for its final season.

Tonight, Succession won that prize for its final season.
Cranston began onstage tonight by acknowledging their SAG Awards win 10 years ago and he was followed by Gunn, who began noting what each of the letters in “ensemble” represented.
“The E stands for the excellence that each cast member brings to every exciting episode,” Gunn said.

Odenkirk continued with the letter N, saying, “N stands for No f*cking way I’m going to do this cheesy thing where you say each letter of the word. I’m not doing it.”
Norris interjected and said, “Teleprompter my ass. I got a beer and a couple of shots backstage, so let this thing going.”

Mitte chimed in and said his grandma wouldn’t “put this on a pillow, it’s so cheesy.”

Brandt questioned what SAG would do to them if they didn’t follow directions, to which Banks said, “It’s an award show, for Christ’s sake; they can’t fire us. So, f*ck them!”

Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone’s Next Movie ‘Kinds of Kindness’ Sets Summer Release Date.

“Kinds of Kindness,” the next collaboration between director Yorgos Lanthimos and star Emma Stone, will debut in theaters this summer.

Searchlight, the indie studio that’s distributing the film, added it to the release calendar on June 21.

Though the plot remains under wraps, “Kinds of Kindness” is an anthology film that reunites Stone with her “Poor Things” co-stars Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, as well as “The Favourite” actor Joe Alwyn. Jesse Plemons, Hong Chau and Hunter Schafer will round out the cast.

Lanthimos penned the screenplay with Efthimis Filippou, with whom he co-wrote the dark thrillers and absurdist comedies, “The Lobster,” “Killing of a Sacred Deer” and “Dogtooth.” The movie, originally titled “And,” was shot in New Orleans in late 2022.
“Kinds of Kindness” is the fifth collaboration between Stone and Lanthimos, who just reunited on “Poor Things,” a Frankenstein-esque fantasy comedy that earned Stone her second Oscar for best actress. That film, also distributed by Searchlight, won four Academy Awards in total, including production and costume design. “Poor Things,” starring Stone as a woman who commits suicide and is brought back to life with the brain of her unborn infant, is still playing in theaters and has impressively surpassed $100 million worldwide.

Stone and Lanthimos also worked together on 2018’s Oscar winner “The Favourite” and the short film “Bleat.” They are already in talks to arrange their sixth movie, a remake of the South Korean fantasy comedy “Save the Green Planet.”

Stone has spoken about her creative partnership with Lanthimos, saying: “Yorgos feels like a lot of his process of working with people or putting people in his films has to do with who they are as a person. It’s not just performance-based.”

Ryan Gosling planned out his cute 'I'm Just Ken' moment with Emma Stone at the Oscars
Ryan Gosling may not have won the best supporting actor trophy at the Academy Awards on Sunday, but he did win the whole show with his "I'm Just Ken" performance.

Gosling's rendition of the Oscar-nominated "Barbie" song brought down the house, but one detail in particular had fans excited: his reunion with former costar Emma Stone.

On the red carpet for the premiere of his new action-comedy film "The Fall Guy" at the SXSW Film & TV Festival on Tuesday, Gosling spoke to Business Insider about the viral moment.

"Her dress ripped!" Gosling laughed. (Stone accepted her best actress Oscar with a busted gown later in the show and joked during her speech that she was pretty sure the wardrobe malfunction happened because she was so excited during Gosling's performance of "I'm Just Ken.")
The actor, who previously starred with Stone in "Crazy, Stupid, Love" and "La La Land," said it was "so fun" interacting with his longtime friend during the performance.

"I'll work with her any chance I get, you know? And that was my chance in that moment," Gosling told BI. "It's always fun."
During the performance, Gosling also shared moments with "Barbie" director Greta Gerwig and his costars Margot Robbie and America Ferrera. According to choreographer Mandy Moore, who worked with Gosling on planning the performance, Gosling felt strongly about paying respect to the women and wanted to make sure Robbie, Gerwig, and Ferrera were seated right in front of him.

"Then when we saw the seating plot, and I was like, 'Emma is right there. Why don't you go to those three first?' — because he was like, 'I just need to pay respect to these ladies. They are amazing. And they're the whole reason I'm here,'" Moore told The Hollywood Reporter.

"Then I was like, 'Why don't you do the second one to Emma? She's right there. It'd be such a good little Easter egg for everybody. You've done so many films with her,'" Moore continued.

Moore told Variety that Gosling even picked out the specific line he wanted to share with Stone during the performance.

"He was pretty clear about his overall structure of it," the choreographer told Variety of Gosling's work plotting out the performance.

Stone, for her part, said in the post-Oscars pressroom that she had a blast interacting with Gosling during the performance — busted dress and all.

Newcastle United wonderkid Trevan Sanusi has been the major positive from the Magpies' youth set-up this season leaving head coach Eddie Howe impressed with his progress.

Still just 16, the youngster is playing above his age group with Ben Dawson's Under-21s after arriving from Birmingham City for a nominal amount of compensation last summer. But his value is tipped to soar in the next few years after the Blues were left devastated by his departure.

Birmingham chiefs believed that Sanusi would take Jude Bellingham's record at St Andrew's as their youngest debutant before Newcastle struck. The Magpies beat Manchester United to his signature and this season Sanusi has hit the ground running.
