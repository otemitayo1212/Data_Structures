	Here's What Jayson Tatum Told Celtics After Ime Udoka's Removal
Right before training camp last year, the Celtics had to figure out how to move forward without Ime Udoka, who had led them on a Finals run.

Why was Jesse Pinkman so important to Walter White in "Breaking Bad"?

Did Walter White really care for Jesse Pinkman, or did he just use him for his own purpose?
When Vince Gilligan was still developing Breaking Bad, the original plan was to Kill Jesse by the end of season 1. The fascinating chemistry between Walt and Jesse prompted the makers to extend the character of Jesse, and the rest is history.

The relationship between Walt and Jesse certainly more than a teacher-student, mentor-prodigy. It was more like a father and son as the series grew.

In many ways, Jesse is Walt's perfect vision of a son he never had. The feelings were mutual at least till season 5.
A TikTok pastor says that before Rihanna landed her gig as a Super Bowl 2023 halftime show performer, the pop star was headlining in the depths of hell.

Gerald Johnson, a religious figure and leader of the Gerald A. Johnson Ministries in Texas, shared a video on the social media site recalling a 2016 journey to Satan's playground, which occurred after his spirit left his body and traveled to the center of the earth. That's "where hell is," he said in the clip below.

There, he was treated to the perks of the fiery abyss, including what can only be described as a performance art piece involving a man — burned from head to toe — being dog-walked by a demon holding a chain. Then, pardon the pun, all hell broke loose.

"It still baffles me to this day. There's a section in hell where music was playing. It was the same music that we hear on the Earth, but as opposed to entertainers singing it, the music, demons were singing it. It was some of the same lyrics we hear here," he said, adding that when today's musical acts do drugs to explore their craft, they can open a portal to hell so that demons can whisper lyrics that will allow Satan to control humans.

"Here, music is to get over a breakup. 'Don't worry, be happy,' 'I bust the windows out your car,' or, 'under my umbrella,' whatever," he continued, referencing songs by Bob Marley, Jazmine Sullivan, and, of course, Rihanna's 2007 smash "Umbrella," which features Jay-Z.

"Every lyric to every song is to torment you as to the fact that you didn't worship God through music when you were on the Earth. You had a chance to worship him in church and at home and through music, but you chose to worship Satan by repeating the lyrics that he inspired to come into the earth."
