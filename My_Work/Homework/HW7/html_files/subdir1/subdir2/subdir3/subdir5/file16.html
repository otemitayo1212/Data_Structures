Rihanna 'selling penthouse once owned by Matthew Perry for $25 million' - less than one year after purchasing luxury LA dwelling.
Rihanna is reportedly selling a luxurious LA penthouse once owned by Matthew Perry - less than a year after purchasing the 40th floor unit.

The songstress, 36, bought the dwelling last spring from Afterpay co-founder Nick Molnar, who purchased it from the late Friends star back in 2021.

Now, Rihanna is allegedly selling it for a little less than $25 million, according to the Robb Report.
The Diamonds songstress has reportedly yet to move into the unit and has been attempting to find a buyer off-market for the last few months. Robb Robert claims current listings of the unit feature photos of 'clearly staged interiors.'

DailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Rihanna for comment.
Hearing of the news, 2K Games digital marketing director Ronnie Singh, known as "Ronnie 2K" in the gaming community, decided to step in. He announced 2K Games, which releases the signature video game NBA 2K yearly (Bryant is this year's cover athlete), reached a deal with the landlord to keep the mural alive for at least one more year.

"For weeks and months, people have lined up in front of this beautiful mural, taking pictures. For us to be a part of saving this thing is just a celebration of basketball," Singh told reporters on Thursday, via USA Today. "This one means a lot to our community. It's basketball related. It's Kobe Bryant. Our cover star for NBA 2K24 is Kobe Bryant. It made sense for us to get involved.

"We felt a moral responsibility to jump in and say, ‘We want to make a difference.’ Not words, but actions," Singh added.

2K Games and the landlord met for weeks before the company gave the landlord a "philanthropic donation."
The mural, painted by Louie "Sloe Motions" Palsino, features the late father and daughter looking at one another, with Bryant in his Los Angeles Lakers jersey and Gianna in her "Mamba Academy" jersey, both draped with angelic wings in clouds.

"I DO NOT support their actions or the way they handled things," Moran wrote in an Instagram post. "... I am not an ungrateful person, but if you knew the full extent of what I'm going through, you would understand my frustration. Right now, I have nothing to celebrate. The work is unfinished, and I'm still on the firing line while witnessing a big company walk all over a women (sic) and small business for publicity while creating a problem."
Moran, however, is not a fan of how business went down between Singh and her landlord, saying the "true heroes" are those who signed the petition.
