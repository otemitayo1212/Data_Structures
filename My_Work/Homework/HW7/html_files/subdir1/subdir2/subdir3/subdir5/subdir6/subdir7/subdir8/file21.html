Adele ‘Someone Like You’
Singer finally releases second video from smash hit record

BY ROLLING STONE

I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over. Never mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the

Someone like you: how Adele's broken-hearted ballads become blockbusters
This article is more than 8 years old
As the singer’s third album breaks all chart records, five experts discover why such sad, sparse songs spell success. Is it ‘anti-marketing’? ‘Emotional bridging’? Ancient Greek catharsis, or simple neuroscience?

The industry figure: Greg James, presenter of BBC Radio 1’s drive time show and The Official Chart
I think a lot of people associate Adele’s albums with specific times in their life – I know I do. I remember hearing Hometown Glory for the first time in 2007, when I’d literally got off the phone from the boss of Radio 1 who had offered me a job – I heard it as I was driving home to tell my mum and dad so I always remember that. A week after Adele sung Someone Like You at the Brits, on my show we decided to get some people on the phone to sing the chorus and give us a bit of background – tell us who they were singing it for. We thought it would be quite silly but actually it turned into this release of emotions. It was a really lovely moment and something that got such a big response. One of the reasons why Adele works well on the radio is that her music is almost like a shared pain. If you hear someone saying “actually, I’m not OK at the moment and I want to speak to my ex”, people can really relate to that. You’re sharing your heartbreak with Adele and that makes you feel better. Sort of.

The psychologist: Daniel Müllensiefen, senior lecturer and co-director of the MSc Music, Mind, and Brain at Goldsmiths, University of London
We can find pleasure in sad music, very much like how we can find pleasure in drama and tragedy. This has been known since the times of Greek theatre – but don’t forget there is a difference between actual felt sadness and aesthetic sadness which can be enjoyed. Adele’s main lure is her amazing voice and her highly emotional singing style – and the sadness in her music can be restorative for many, something that is very much in line with the catharsis that the early Greek drama theorists described. This kind of collective sadness works especially well in November and in the run up to Christmas – just ask the retailers about it. Another example of this is the John Lewis Christmas ads, especially this year’s one, and their use of melancholy music.

The marketing expert: Anna Derbyshire, senior marketing manager, RCA Records UK

What has always been notable about the marketing of Adele is how simple it is. Monochrome photos and promos, the linear logo, a number for each album title, the black A-line dresses, and recently the ‘white text on black’ lyric video that was the teaser ad in X Factor announcing that the new album was imminent. The simplicity of this latest album campaign serves to underline the message that her audience like and are expecting. It’s saying, “Everything is about the voice, the songs and the emotion; nothing’s changed. She has no need for the sideshows employed by lesser talents. This isn’t even marketing, it’s simply an announcement. Adele is the real deal, she feels what you feel, and she won’t let you down. There will be no surprises.”

The (formerly) heartbroken: Paul Bridgewater, editor of The Line of Best Fit
If you regard pop music to be about the relatable, and holding a mirror up to the mundane, euphoric or traumatic events in our everyday lives, Adele could just be the pinnacle of all that. I remember breaking up with someone and it took a year to get a handle on it. Then I heard Someone Like You for the first time and I just fell apart. I often wonder if she realised what she was writing – it’s a sentiment that taps into every “one that got away” breakup ever. When you hear that song, it’s the worst kind of emotionally destructive indulgence, like you’re rubbing salt into a wound, but you can’t stop because the song creates this emotional bridging. She gives colour to the fantasy you have about going back to that person and telling them: “Babe, it ain’t over for me, I haven’t moved on, I never will.”

Nicole Kidman (born June 20, 1967, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.) American-born Australian actress known for her considerable range and versatility as well as for her glamorous looks and cool demeanour.

Early life and career
Kidman was born in Honolulu to Australian parents. She was raised in Sydney and launched her acting career as a teenager. She appeared in made-for-television films and miniseries during her adolescence and debuted as a lead actress in the thriller Dead Calm (1989). The offer of a role in Days of Thunder (1990) drew her to the United States. While working on that film she began a relationship with costar Tom Cruise; the two were married in 1990 (divorced 2001). Over the next decade Kidman appeared in a dozen films. Her roles included a gangster-loving socialite in Billy Bathgate (1991), an aspiring television journalist in the black comedy To Die For (1995), and an American living in Europe during the 1800s in Jane Campion’s 1996 screen adaptation of Henry James’s The Portrait of a Lady (1996).

Kidman quickly rebounded, however, with a series of diverse roles that highlighted the range of her talent. In the Baz Luhrmann musical fantasy Moulin Rouge! (2001), she starred as a dying courtesan, and the performance earned Kidman her first Academy Award nomination. In 2001 she also appeared in The Others, an atmospheric horror film, and the dark comedy Birthday Girl, in which she played a Russian mail-order bride. Two years later she earned an Academy Award for best actress for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (2002), an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham. A string of critical successes followed, including Dogville (2003), The Human Stain (2003), Cold Mountain (2003), and Margot at the Wedding (2007).

In 2007 Kidman starred as the coolly menacing Mrs. Coulter in The Golden Compass, an adaptation of Philip Pullman’s controversial fantasy novel. She reteamed with Luhrmann for the romantic drama Australia (2008), playing a prim Englishwoman who arrives in Australia just after World War II to defend land she has inherited. In 2009 she appeared in Nine; the musical featured an all-star cast that included Daniel Day-Lewis, Penélope Cruz, and Marion Cotillard.

Roles from the early 2010s
Kidman then portrayed a grieving mother in Rabbit Hole (2010), a film adaptation of David Lindsay-Abaire’s acclaimed play; for her performance, she received a third Academy Award nomination. She subsequently took a role as a catty rival of Jennifer Aniston’s character in the romantic comedy Just Go with It (2011). In the thriller Trespass (2011), Kidman and Nicolas Cage played a married couple whose home is invaded by thieves. In 2012 she starred as the writer Martha Gellhorn, who was briefly married to Ernest Hemingway, in the HBO movie Hemingway & Gellhorn, and she vamped as the fiancée of a death-row inmate in 1960s Florida in the pulp drama The Paperboy. In the psychological horror film Stoker (2013), Kidman appeared as the emotionally distant mother of a troubled teenage girl.

Clippers top Bulls behind James Harden’s triple-double.
Harden records 14 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists and Paul George scores a team-high 22 in a 112-102 victory.
LOS ANGELES — It was an inauspicious start to a foreboding week. The Clippers trailed the Chicago Bulls by as many as 11 points less than four minutes into Saturday’s matinee game.

It was not the kind of start the Clippers envisioned against a middle-of-the-road team. It was not the start they could afford with the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves waiting to visit Crypto.com Arena over the next three days.

But that was the scenario the Clippers were in as they headed to the locker room. Once there, the team came together. So did a game plan.

“We had a talk, and we came out and we delivered on what we talked about,” forward Paul George said.

What they came up with was a need to cut down on turnovers, find the basket and slow the Bulls’ three key players. The plan worked and the Clippers came away with a come-from-behind 112-102 victory over Chicago.

“We’re a vet team, we know what we’re doing,” guard James Harden said. “We started the game off slow, but we missed shots. We had some really good looks; we just didn’t make ’em.

In 2013 Kidman starred opposite Colin Firth in The Railway Man, an adaptation of a memoir about a former soldier who is seeking the Japanese translator who tortured him while he was held captive during World War II. Kidman teamed with Firth again in the thriller Before I Go to Sleep (2014), about a woman dealing with memory loss induced by a trauma. In 2015 she played both a taxidermist intent on skinning the title character in Paddington, an adaptation of the classic children’s book series about a Peruvian bear in London, and a deputy district attorney in Secret in Their Eyes, a thriller that also starred Julia Roberts as an FBI agent whose daughter is raped and murdered.

Resurgence and subsequent films
After several disappointing releases, Kidman appeared in an assortment of well-received movies, leading some pundits to later declare a “Kidmanaissance.” Her credits from 2016 included the biopic Lion, about an Indian boy who becomes separated from his family, is adopted by an Australian couple, and later, as an adult, searches for his lost relatives. The drama received critical acclaim, and Kidman earned her fourth Oscar nomination. Kidman was especially busy in 2017. She gave an Emmy Award-winning performance as an abused wife in the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies, David E. Kelley’s adaptation of Liane Moriarty’s best-selling novel; her costars included Laura Dern, Reese Witherspoon, and Zoë Kravitz. That year Kidman also appeared in the second season of Campion’s TV series Top of the Lake. Her film roles in 2017 included the headmistress of a Southern boarding school in Sofia Coppola’s The Beguiled, which was based on a novel by Thomas Cullinan; the wife of a heart surgeon in the psychological thriller The Killing of a Sacred Deer; a band manager in the adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties; and a high-strung assistant to a wealthy man with quadriplegia in The Upside.

In Aquaman (2018), Kidman played the mother of the eponymous superhero. She took a turn as the wife of a Baptist preacher, who, with her husband, sends their son to a gay conversion therapy program in Boy Erased (2018), which was based on the memoir (2016) of the same name. Kidman garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a grizzled detective who seeks revenge for a botched undercover assignment from her past in Destroyer (2018). In 2019 she reprised her role in Big Little Lies for a second season and appeared as the well-to-do Mrs. Barbour in The Goldfinch, a film based on Donna Tartt’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. Also that year Kidman starred in Bombshell, portraying Gretchen Carlson, a former host on Fox News who accused the channel’s president, Roger Ailes, of sexual harassment.

In 2020 Kidman starred in the miniseries The Undoing, which was created by Kelley and centres on a wealthy therapist whose seemingly perfect life unravels when her husband becomes a murder suspect. That year she also appeared in The Prom, a musical in which a New York theatre troupe travels to a small Indiana town to help a gay teenager. She then reteamed with Kelley on Nine Perfect Strangers (2021), a miniseries that was also based on a novel by Moriarty; Kidman was cast as a mysterious guru at an exclusive wellness retreat. She subsequently portrayed Lucille Ball in Aaron Sorkin’s biopic Being the Ricardos (2021), which centres on a turbulent week in the life of Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem), both of whom starred in the TV comedy series I Love Lucy. For her performance, Kidman earned her fifth Oscar nomination, for best actress. In the action-drama The Northman (2022), she played a Viking queen whose son seeks revenge for his father’s murder.
