	Kobe Bryant mural near Lakers arena to be kept after landlord ordered for removal.
	A mural of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, on a building near Crypto.com Arena, the Los Angeles venue where the late Hall of Famer played for his entire NBA career, was saved from being removed earlier this week.

The landlord of 400 West Pico Blvd. ordered for the mural to be taken down by the end of September in hopes of placing advertisements. It was put up shortly after Bryant and his daughter were killed in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, 2020.

In response, Cecilia Moran, the owner of Hardcore Fitness, located in the building, helped drive a petition seeking to keep it up that received over 90,000 signatures, as well as the support of Bryant's widow, Vanessa. Initially, the deadline for the mural to be taken down was then extended a month.
