	Perhaps no film has electrified audiences and charged up movie groups all over social media in recent times than “Everything Everywhere All At Once”, a phenomenally deranged sci-fi epic that catapults a heartwarming family story to cult status thanks to its cutting edge visual imagery and unexpected narrative quirks. The moment you think you know where the movie is headed is exactly when the makers will pull the rug out from under you, creating so much hysteria and mayhem that you are rendered as confused as the protagonists on screen.

We follow superstar Michelle Yeoh, who seems to be a bored laundromat owner called up by the IRS for a tax audit, only to have her world turned upside down when she encounters a mysterious, multiversal version of her husband who asks her to join him on a journey down a rabbit hole of epic proportions. Tasked with taking down a seemingly megalomaniacal villain named “Jobu Tapaki”, Yeoh’s character traverses the many universes using a technique called verse-jumping, rendered immensely believable and enjoyable by the cutting-edge CGI and visual effects employed by the makers.

The immensely relatable Ke Huy Quan is terrific as Yeoh’s ever suffering husband while Stephanie Hsu is a revelation as her troubled daughter, who constantly disappoints her mother despite her best efforts. Yeoh’s world renowned martial arts skills and prowess as a decorated character actress are harnessed with equal aplomb by directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert to tell a core story of the lengths a mother will go for her daughter, albeit with multiversal consequences at stake.

“Everything Everywhere All at Once” is an absolutely mental sci-fi adventure that blends comedy, fantasy and heart to serve up an immensely entertaining mashup that achieves the multiversal aspirations which “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” set out to accomplish and failed. Michelle Yeoh makes a triumphant return to a mainstream role, with a performance for the ages. Highly, highly recommended!
