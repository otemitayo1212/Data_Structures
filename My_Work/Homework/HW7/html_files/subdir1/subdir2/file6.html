    There's a multiverse of roads not taken in 'Everything Everywhere All at Once'
    Michelle Yeoh stars as a woman who suddenly develops the power to leap between parallel universes in the action-adventure-fantasy Everything Everywhere All at Once.
A24
Multiverses are having something of a moment, popping up in recent movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home and upcoming ones like Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. It's refreshing, then, to get a new multiverse movie this week that doesn't spring from the world of comic-book superheroes. It's called Everything Everywhere All at Once — an apt title for a movie that imagines the existence of thousands of alternate timelines, featuring thousands of alternate versions of ourselves. It was written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, also known as Daniels, who seem intent on topping the anything-goes audacity of Swiss Army Man, their 2016 comedy featuring Daniel Radcliffe as a flatulent corpse.
That strain of juvenile humor pops up frequently here: At one point, characters have to make inventive use of a trophy in order to jump from one universe to the next. But for all its gross sight gags and bizarre supernatural conceits, the movie has one pretty coherent purpose: to provide a dazzling actor's showcase for Michelle Yeoh.

Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant who lives in a cramped apartment with her husband, Waymond, played by Ke Huy Quan. It's a stressful time for the Wangs: Evelyn has her hands full bickering with their teenage daughter, Joy — a terrific Stephanie Hsu — and planning a birthday party for her ailing father, played by the great 93-year-old veteran James Hong. On top of that, the family business, a laundromat, is being audited by the IRS. The action really begins at the IRS office where Evelyn meets with their auditor, well played by Jamie Lee Curtis, who urges the Wangs to get their paperwork in order.

Evelyn might think she knows the story of her life, but she doesn't know the half of it. Through an extremely bizarre series of events, she learns about the existence of all those other universes, each with its own version of Evelyn. She also learns that she's the only person who can save the whole multiverse from destruction by some powerful force that has taken hold of her daughter, Joy. (As a story of conflict and reconciliation between an Asian mother and daughter, Everything Everywhere All at Once would make a nifty double bill with the current Pixar fantasy Turning Red.)

MOVIE REVIEWS
'Turning Red' confronts the messiness of adolescence with refreshing honesty
In order to defeat evil, Evelyn must repeatedly jump between her universe and others, sort of like a video-game avatar, and absorb crucial knowledge from those other Evelyns, all of whom represent different paths she could have taken through life. There's Evelyn the Hong Kong movie star, Evelyn the Peking opera singer and Evelyn the teppanyaki chef. Imagine a very long, unusually surreal Choose Your Own Adventure novel in which all the pages have been torn out and glued back together at random, and you'll have some sense of how this movie plays.

Good thing that Kobe Bryant is getting three statues. The first one has typos.
Shaquille O'Neal boldly claims rival players 'don't fear' LeBron James like they did Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan... but opinion leaves fans split as some claim NBA icon has 'zero idea'
Ex-Heat guard Mario Chalmers also discussed the Lakers star's legacy on Wed.
He said he had faced backlash in the past for once having the same take as Shaq

Shaquille O'Neal has boldly claimed that NBA players in today's era don't fear LeBron James like they did back when Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan used to play, as his opinion leaves fans split with some claiming the NBA icon has 'zero idea'.

O'Neal - a Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer and NBA TNT analyst - dished out his take while talking with former Heat guard Mario Chalmers, who won two rings with James in Miami, on 'The Big Podcast,' co-hosted by none other than 'Shaq Daddy' himself.

'I've heard players say, including myself, ''I feared Mike [Jordan].'' I've heard players in [Chalmers'] generation say they feared Kobe,' O'Neal said, at first.


'I've never really heard any player say they feared LeBron.'

O'Neal went on to describe James as a 'nice guy' after Chalmers said that he once faced backlash in the past for having the same opinion as the former big man.
