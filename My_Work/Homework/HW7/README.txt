Reflection and Self Assessment

Issues Encountered:
During development and testing, I encountered various issues. I had to ensure that the snippet extracted from the line contained complete sentences around the query. To achieve this, I implemented logic to traverse backward and forward from the found word until a sentence boundary was reached. Additionally, I had to handle cases where the query was not found in the line and ensure the snippet captured the entire line in such scenarios.

Research and Learning:
I had to research and understand string manipulation in C++, specifically functions like find and substr. Additionally, I learned about handling boundary cases while extracting snippets from text data.

Challenges Faced:
The most challenging part of the assignment was devising a method to extract meaningful snippets that contained complete sentences around the query. It required careful consideration of edge cases and thorough testing to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

Insights Gained:
Through this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of text processing techniques in C++ and improved my problem-solving skills, particularly in handling string manipulation tasks. The development and testing process helped me solidify my understanding of string functions and their usage in practical scenarios.

Overall, the development and testing process went well, albeit with some challenges along the way. By addressing these challenges and iteratively refining my implementation, I was able to successfully complete the assignment.
