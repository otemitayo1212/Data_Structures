Reflection and Self Assessment

During the development and testing of this assignment, I encountered several challenges. Initially, understanding the structure of the JSON file and parsing it accurately posed some difficulties. I had to carefully study the provided code and experiment with different approaches to correctly extract the relevant information from the JSON file.

Another challenge I faced was understanding how to organize the comments into a hierarchical structure and handle operations such as replying to comments, liking comments, and deleting comments effectively. Implementing the logic to link parent comments with their replies required careful consideration and testing.

I had to research various aspects of C++, including file handling, string manipulation, and the use of standard library containers like vectors and unordered maps. Understanding the syntax for lambda functions and iterators also took some time.

Throughout the development process, I encountered errors such as segmentation faults, invalid memory accesses, and syntax errors. Debugging these issues required careful examination of the code and stepping through it with a debugger to identify the root causes. I also relied on print statements to trace the flow of execution and pinpoint the source of errors.

Overall, the development and testing process was challenging but rewarding. It helped me deepen my understanding of C++ programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
