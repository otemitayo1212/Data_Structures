## Reflection and Self Assessment

While working on this assignment, I faced challenges with data extraction from the JSON-like data and managing the priority queues effectively. I had to research methods for string manipulation and priority queue implementation in C++. Additionally, I had to ensure proper error handling to address cases where certain data fields were missing or malformed.

The most challenging aspect of the assignment was managing the priority queues for both hashtags and sounds, particularly when dealing with ties in view counts and counts of occurrences. However, through deeper exploration of priority queues and operator overloading, I was able to implement the necessary logic to handle these scenarios effectively.

Overall, despite encountering minor hurdles, I found the development and testing process to be rewarding. I successfully implemented the required functionality to analyze TikTok trends based on hashtags and sounds, showcasing my problem-solving skills and perseverance.
