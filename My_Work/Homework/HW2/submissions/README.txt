MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:
I came across lots of challenges during the implementation of the request and cancel functionalities. Despite extensive debugging efforts, I struggled to identify the root cause of issues in these sections.

## Reflection and Self Assessment

During the development and testing of this assignment, I encountered several challenges and learned valuable lessons. The main issues and learnings include:

- **Code Complexity:** Managing the  codebase proved challenging, and keeping track of all the lines required careful attention to detail.

- **Debugging:** Debugging was time-consuming due to the code's length and complexity. I had to carefully review each section to identify and rectify errors.

- **Variable Naming:** The choice of some variable names could have been more descriptive. Clear and informative names would enhance code readability.

- **Code Duplication:** I noticed some code redundancy, particularly in handling ride requests. I learned the importance of refactoring to eliminate duplication and improve maintainability.

- **Modularity:** The code lacked clear modularity, making it harder to maintain. I realized the significance of breaking down code into smaller, more manageable functions with specific responsibilities.

- **Testing Challenges:** Testing a complex program with various scenarios was challenging. I learned the importance of comprehensive test cases to ensure the correct functioning of the code.

- **Learning Curve:** Understanding the entire codebase, including the Rider and Driver classes, took time. I realized the importance of a gradual learning process and the need to seek clarification on unfamiliar concepts.
