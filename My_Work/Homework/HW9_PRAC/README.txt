Reflection and Self Assessment
During development and testing, I encountered difficulties with creating the B+ tree structure. I had to refer to YouTube videos to better understand the implementation. Researching and learning about B+ trees was a significant aspect of this assignment.

I found creating the B+ tree and implementing the range search and sorting functionalities challenging. However, after spending time understanding the concepts and practicing, things started to click. The development and testing process was a learning experience, and while challenging, it helped solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
