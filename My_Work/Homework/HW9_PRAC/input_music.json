Verdi's music rises to the tremendous demands of this subject matter; it is music of grandeur, guilt, terror, and consolation, with a breadth of vision and an intensity of feeling unique in the composer's work and in religious music. John Eliot Gardiner's is the first recording made with period instruments, a kind of performance that some musiclovers still dismiss as dilettantism, more concerned with musicological correctness than feeling and communication. Gardiner's powerful performance blows such objections away, and this recording takes a rightful place alongside the best modern instrument versions.", "--Joe McLellan"], "price": 24.98, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51onKEi3O8L._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51onKEi3O8L.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pnje9RDTL._SL1200_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519+gJi4LlL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519+gJi4LlL.jpg", "variant": "BACK", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81q7zwuN3+L._SL1280_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Verdi, G  (Performer),     Various Artists  (Contributor),     Verdi / Gardiner / Monteverdi Choir  (Contributor),     Orgonasova/Von Otter/Canonici  (Contributor),     Gardiner/Revolutionnaire Et Ro  (Contributor)    &                   2                  more   Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer": "No", "Language": "English", "Product Dimensions": "5.59 x 5.04 x 0.94 inches; 6.7 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Philips", "Item model number": "28944214222", "Original Release Date": "1995", "SPARS Code": "DDD", "Date First Available": "July 27, 2006", "Label": "Philips", "Number of discs": "2"}, "parent_asin": "B00000418W", "bought_together": null}

As Paul Rodgers remembers; \"Jimmy was at a bit of a loose end. He'd come round and check out my home studio and we ended up writing songs, but without any definite plans. Jimmy was very keen to get back on the road, so we put a band together The first thing I knew was that he had to be writing songs again. I'd already seen one of my friends going down that road in Koss, and it wasn't going to happen again.\" During their tenure, The Firm released two studio albums; their eponymous debut in 1985, and Mean Business in 86. The band played a few dates in the UK at the end of 1984, and toured the US in both 1985 and 1986. One of the finest gigs the Firm performed however was at London s Wembley Arena on 22nd May 1985, when they played a quite astonishing set which was recorded for live FM Radio Broadcast across the UK and the US, and which remains a formidable example of mid-1980s British rock music at its very best.

But Brendel's fans and Schubertians will still want this two-disc set, which offers the pianist's current views of the music. Recorded from concerts, the playing has the extra communicative flair often absent from the sterile atmosphere of the studio. The set includes Brendel's first recording of the lovely D. 575, perhaps the finest of the early Schubert Sonatas. While his playing here is well within the parameters of his earlier conception of these works, Brendel brings an extra dollop of expansiveness and tension that pays off in places, such as his slower introduction to the G Major Sonata and the sharpened contrast he gives the first two movements of the last and greatest of the works, the B-flat Major.

They were to be known as Acappella's \"vocal band.\" And it stuck. The new quintet debuted as the back-up group for Acappella shortly thereafter and the rest is history. Their first two albums, Give Me light and Stepping On A Cloud quickly became favorites of all who heard this \"new\" sound. Over the years, as AVB's sound matured, these original two releases went out of print - never to be heard again. Or so we thought. More than fifteen years later, the original session tapes have been rediscovered and digitally restored. Now you can hear them like you've never heard them before. On top of that, while digging through the archives, we discovered one song that was recorded by the early AVB and was never released. It is included in this collection. We proudly present to you AVB: The Early Years. Available now Songs included: Work At It - never before released!

In retrospect however, the album has fared much better and is now the subject of one of the esteemed Classic Rock documentaries. In the wake of the record, Zappa and the then current MOI line up went out on the road for a short North American Tour. With George Duke on keys, Tom Fowler on bass, Chester Thompson on drums, Ruth Underwood on percussion and Napoleon Murphy Brock on sax, the group performed at Austin, Texas Armadillo World Headquarters on 26th October 73, where they put on an extraordinary show which was recorded for live FM radio broadcast.

Eaglesmith was one of nine children born to a farming family in rural southern Ontario. Often employing his difficult upbringing as raw material for his heartland narratives, he issued his self-titled debut LP in 1980. He recorded infrequently throughout the remainder of the decade, releasing only two more albums, The Boy That Just Went Wrong and Indiana Road. However, Eaglesmith gradually became an underground favorite in his native Canada, thanks largely to a relentless touring schedule in tandem with bassist Ralph Schipper and mandolinist Willie P. Bennett. In 1991, he released the double live collection There Ain't No Easy Road, followed two years later by Things Is Changin'.

As music industry lore acknowledges, the line-up of Ohio-formed group The Deele included future super producers and (LaFace) label owners Antonio 'L. A. ' Reid and Kenny 'Babyface' Edmonds. The Deele's first three Solar albums (released between 1983-1987) - presented as expanded editions on this 3-CD set - showcase not only the burgeoning skills of the renowned hit-making pair but also the kind of funky R&B-and-pop fusion that was at the very heart of the music of the '80s, which, some three decades later, is being afforded a new level of appreciation by a whole new generation of music buyers. With their distinctive 'look' (that - with eyeliners and pancake makeup - was very different from most male funk bands of the day) and high energy live performances, The Deele had already established a solid following among audiences in Cincinnati and Indianapolis by the time members of the group Midnight Star brought The Deele to the attention of Solar Records' founder Dick Griffey who famously signed the group without ever seeing them. Produced by Midnight Star's Reggie Calloway, the 1983 \"Street Beat\" album spawned three U. S. R&B charted singles, 'Body Talk', 'I Surrender' and 'Just My Luck'. 1985's \"Material Thangz\" LP gave the group an opportunity to hone their production and writing skills; while 1987's \"Eyes Of A Stranger\" set provided The Deele with two back-to-back hits in the form of the now-classic 'Two Occasions' and 'Shoot 'Em Up Movies'. In addition to the three original Solar albums (containing all of The Deele's U. S. charted hits), this retrospective features a total of ten bonus tracks include 'Dry Your Eyes' (a hidden gem non-album 'B' side), as well as remixes of 'Let's Work Tonight', 'Suspicious', 'Surrender' and 'Sweet Nothingz'. Liner notes by SoulMusic Records and soulmusic. Com founder David Nathan include quotes from 2018 interviews with original group members Kayo and Dee and longtime colleague and renowned songwriter/producer Sid Johnson (who co-penned 'Two Occasions') as well as first class mastering by Nick Robbins; and stellar artwork from Roger Williams."], "price": 23.73, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vYNr2-wVL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51vYNr2-wVL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71G+qq4aU+L._SL1225_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pMGIo7MwL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pMGIo7MwL.jpg", "variant": "BACK", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F0fGxsYcL._SL1230_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "DEELE  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Product Dimensions": "5.31 x 5.28 x 0.75 inches; 4.52 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Soulmusic Records", "Original Release Date": "2018", "Date First Available": "October 3, 2018", "Label": "Soulmusic Records", "Number of discs": "3"}, "parent_asin": "B07HGJ3Z57", "bought_together": null}

Sheckley, a native New Yorker living in Ibiza, Spain, commissioned artist Leonor Quiles to illustrate the book, from which several drawings are included in the compact-disc package currently available on the Voiceprint label (1993). The disc is divided into 12 untitled tracks on which Sinfield presents the story, which is actually more like a series of vignettes, in his distinctive British accent. A real curio, Clear Colours concerns an earthling who has been deposited, via space pod, on an uncharted planet suspected of containing lifeforms. Upon examination, he encounters the nonhuman forms, is able to communicate with them and, realizing he will never be rescued, quickly adapts to his new surroundings. He becomes friends with these creatures, even to the extent of obtaining a lover, and acclimates quite comfortably. Some standout episodes include those of hunting, sexual practices, drug use and drug experiences, and metamorphosis."], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/410+y1CbXdL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/410+y1CbXdL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Robert Sheckley  (Author),     Brian Eno  (Performer),     Peter Sinfield  (Performer)    &                   0                  more   Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Manufacturer": "Voiceprint", "Date First Available": "October 13, 2006", "Label": "Voiceprint", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B000JLGK6I", "bought_together": null}

His incredible musicality can easily imagined to be \u0093a result of being touched by a fairy godmother's wand\u0094 \u0096 as the British magazine Gramophone, the undisputed authority on classical music, put it. William Primrose was indeed a gifted musician whose tone was inimitable and who achieved a lot for the appreciation of his often underrated instrument. He was one of the most important pioneers of viola playing, instrumental in giving the viola its status as a solo instrument. This compilation of 12 original albums and bonus tracks from the years 1935 to 1961 introduces an artist who is considered to be one of the most important soloists of the 20th century and, moreover, has written music history as a passionate chamber musician with legendary trio formations. Included are recordings with the Heifetz Primrose Feuermann ensemble (Beethoven, Schubert), examples of the highly successful collaboration with the Griller Quartet (Mozart Quintets), Brahms Sonatas with Rudolf Firkusny and recordings with the great Marian Anderson. Not to be missed are Walton's Viola-Concerto under the baton of the composer, Bizet's Harold en Italie, as well as pearls of the solo repertoire and chamber music by Schubert, Bach, Benjamin, Kreisler, Handel, Dvorak, Paganini, Rachmaninoff, Massenet and many more."], "price": 31.09, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5182oXxAODL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5182oXxAODL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PxDNDOMgL._SL1000_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PhF-5iu5L._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PhF-5iu5L.jpg", "variant": "BACK", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91FQkBxG6yL._SL1500_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "PRIMROSE,WILLIAM  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Product Dimensions": "5.28 x 5.2 x 0.98 inches; 10.37 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "DOCUMENTS", "Date First Available": "July 9, 2019", "Label": "DOCUMENTS", "Number of discs": "10"}, "parent_asin": "B07QKW8Z92", "bought_together": null}

It was based on the popular Dr. Kildare movies of the late 1930's and early 1940's, and brought to the microphone the stars of that series, Lew Ayres and Lionel Barrymore. Ayres played the young, idealistic Dr. James Kildare; Barrymore, ever in character, was the crusty, loveable diagnostician, Dr. Leonard Gillespie. The men worked at Blair General Hospital, \"one of the great citadels of American medicine -- a clump of gray-white buildings planted deep in the heart of New York -- where life begins, where life ends, where life goes on.\" Kildare really believed that oath, and that's what this series was all about. His battle with hospital administration, stupid patients, and stupid parents made this the Marcus Welby of the 1940's. The chief problem, both for Kildare and the listener, was that Blair Hospital was peopled by too many eccentrics. Gillespie, played to the limit by Barrymore, was enough for any show. But Dr. Carew, head of hospital administration, was a nut of the first order. Nurse Parker was a totally unbelievable old maid. Ted Osborne did what he could with Carew, and Virginia Gragg's fine talent was hopelessly lost in the chattering role of Parker. In the end, Ayres and Barrymore saved this series, providing some solid stories, especially when they ventured into the real world and got away from the dummies at Blair. Writing and directing were done on a freelance basis; music was by Walter Schumann. Actors contributing to Dr. Kildare included Stacy Harris, Isabel Jewell, Jay Novello, George Ellis, Paul Frees, Raymond Burr, and Jack Webb."], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3D58vEiL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41W3D58vEiL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Format: MP3 CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Date First Available": "May 12, 2012"}, "parent_asin": "B0082OD2E2", "bought_together": null}

These figures are even more impressive when one appreciates that Jackie could neither read nor write music, instead describing to assistants the tunes he conceived in his head!

In part this split would have come about because of the pioneering blues work from Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies, who were both London based. Newcastle's Animals and Belfast's Them were the two biggest exceptions. This 2CD set includes all the Animals' BBC Saturday Club sessions - 28 songs in all - plus a further 22 songs broadcast in front of a live audience and 7 fascinating interviews. Amongst the highlights are their contributions to a Granada TV show Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On . Check out the clip on the net - the camera sweeps across and Eric kicks into the a cappella intro to Talkin' 'Bout You supported only by hand clapping; there's a flourish from Alan Price's Vox and they're off. Elsewhere the boys conjure up images of people like Pinetop Perkins via Ray Charles' early classic Mess Around ; they give us their take on the much recorded See See Rider which doesn't owe a debt to anyone; and they deliver a swinging I Got To Find My Baby with plenty of ad hoc extras from Eric. Several of those great hit singles (plus a flip plus some LP tracks) are here too, all benefitting from full 'road testing'; Hooker's Boom Boom is a stand -out with mood switching between intimacy and all out rocking. Round about the time the Animals' first single was released, I saw the band perform in one of those Central London clubs you have to go downstairs to reach. They were the toughest of the British R&B Groups. They were the real thing.

Mozart, Concerti, Pierre W. Feit, Oboe, Vienna Chamber Orchestra, Philippe Entremont, Conductor. Koch Schwann Musica Mundi CD 311 075 GI, 1985. Pierre Feit... is accompanied by the Viennese Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Philippe Entremont in this 1985 recording... Tempos are quick; Feit's oboe playing is deft and bird-like. He is moving so quickly in the first movement of Mozart's K. 285, there seems to be no time to play short notes short, or bother to separate phrases... The cadenza contains many notes and is astonishing in its virtuosity... The Vienna Chamber Orchestra seems to be striving for a suspended, breathless approach to playing Mozart, matching the oboist's tendency not to breathe and phrase, and turning the whole thing into one continuous strand. The second movement cadenza is tasteful and to the point. The third movement proves Feit's staccato, as he maneuvers through the quick passage work and ornaments with unfailing agility and forward momentum... The majestic opening of what liner annotator Friedhelm Onkelbach would still prefer to believe is Haydn's Concerto in C for Oboe is persuasive to the doubter. Trumpets and drums! Elegance, pageantry and ceremony! Why aren't there more recordings of this concerto? Here Feit's tempo seems perfect, his rapid arpeggios and scale patterns meticulous... The orchestra provides exciting contrast, punctuating the soloist with bursts of frenzied grandeur. In the second and third movements, Feit provides us with some interesting alternatives to standard editions and interpretations of this concerto. The third movement variations, plenty sprightly, contain the most amazing technical display of the entire recording."], "price": 6.99, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+UIiWQIUL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+UIiWQIUL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Pierre W Feit  (Author),     Philippe Entremont  (Author),     Vienna Chamber Orchestra  (Author)    &                   0                  more   Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Date First Available": "June 26, 2009"}, "parent_asin": "B002EZ3MPE", "bought_together": null}

The Complete box is an absolute necessity, first because it contains several previously unreleased albums, like On the Glory Road and From This Moment On, a live concert taped in Las Vegas that collectors have been salivating over since 1964. But more important, the new box is essential because up to now, Bennett has been the one singer of his stature to have such a large part of his canon unavailable in the digital era. Over the last 25 years, it has been possible to obtain virtually everything ever done by such Bennett peers as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, and Sarah Vaughan, yet somehow many absolutely classic Tony Bennett albums have never seen the light of day on CD: Hometown My Town, Love Story, Get Happy with the London Philharmonic, Summer of '42, Yesterday I Heard the Rain, Tony Makes It Happen, and many others. Bennett's career has been a long one: the box covers a span of 65 years, starting with that 1946 aircheck (originating from occupied Germany), when PFC Bennett was probably not yet 20, and goes up to Duets II, the last tracks of which (including duets with Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga) were recorded as he was gearing up for his 85th birthday. (In fact, producer Didier Deutsch and engineer Dae Bennett, the singer's son, were already working on this box when Tony had yet to record some of the tracks for Duets II.) The overall effect of the package, 73 CDs and three DVDs, is overwhelming. (The videos include his Grammy-winning MTV Unplugged special from 1994; An American Classic, a documentary produced by Clint Eastwood around the time of Mr. Bennett's 80th; and a very rare filmed concert from 1970 with the London Philharmonic.)"], "price": 425.0, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eVl21gmxL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eVl21gmxL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91YIGSabINL._SL1500_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jun3qCuxL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jun3qCuxL.jpg", "variant": "BACK", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912jEnL3R1L._SL1500_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hJRTnel2L._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hJRTnel2L.jpg", "variant": "PT01", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PMIZFqc9L._SL1500_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517xL5sBP1L._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517xL5sBP1L.jpg", "variant": "PT02", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91gZ+5cpgUL._SL1500_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Bennett,Tony  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer": "No", "Package Dimensions": "11 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches; 6.51 Pounds", "Manufacturer": "PID", "Date First Available": "November 13, 2011", "Label": "PID", "Number of discs": "76"}, "parent_asin": "B00656URAQ", "bought_together": null}

A prolific composer, he really captured the essence of the films and the characters with his evocative and perfect music. His music is a key element in making those films unique. The scoring usually consists of recurring themes for Kurt and Linda, and the approach to orchestration is usually spare and filled with interesting textures and melodic invention, somehow capturing perfectly the loneliness, the cold, the sordidness of some of the crimes, the despair. Most of the music is contemplative in nature, but there\u2019s some wonderful action music, too, especially in the \u201cMastermind\u201d film. While some of the music has been available as downloads only and only outside the United States it has never had a proper CD release. The show now has so many fans, thanks to its being aired in the UK and elsewhere (and now on DVD) that doing a CD release seemed like a no-brainer. The selections as presented here were personally chosen and assembled by Norden (who also contributes to the liner notes) and are from his masters, which he owns. If you\u2019re a fan of the Wallander films, especially of that brilliant first series, then this will be a lovely souvenir of the music that made that series so memorable. If you haven\u2019t seen the series, the music stands perfectly well on its own and is a wonderful listening experience."], "price": 65.38, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ssdSyAOiL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ssdSyAOiL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Adam Norden  (Composer)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.97 x 0.54 inches; 2.88 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Kritzerland", "Item model number": "KR 200232", "Date First Available": "September 13, 2012", "Label": "Kritzerland", "Country of Origin": "France", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B008UTAV2K", "bought_together": null}

The Flashman Papers 1839-1842 Volume One Flashman, soldier, duellist, lover, imposter, coward, cad and hero, triumphs in this first instalment of The Flashman Papers. His adventures as the reluctant secret agent in Afghanistan and his entry into the exclusive company of Lord Cardigan's Hussars culminate in his foulest hour -- his part in the historic disaster of the Retreat from Kabul.

Life is a continuous cycle of holding on to and letting go of the people, places and things that are most special to us. All of us are part of this cycle - children as well as adults. Separating from what we love is the most difficult thing we are asked to do in this life. Sometimes, the hardest part is holding on. And often, it's the letting go we can't seem to bring ourselves to do. Yet, through this cycle comes our greatest growth.", "This collection offers a mix of my own pure memory delivered in story, and some pieces of memory carefully interwoven with imagination and transformed into story. Whether you listen to this tape with your family or on your own, it is my hope that somewhere in this collection you will find something to help ease your path; something that will give you a little strength and bring you closer to your own heart's healing. There is so much beauty and joy along the way. Don't miss it.", "- Carrie Jean Wharton", "About the Artist", "Carrie Jean Wharton has been writing and storytelling professionally since 1994.

{"main_category": "Digital Music", "title": "Time Machine", "average_rating": 4.0, "rating_number": 19, "features": [], "description": ["Remastered expanded edition of composer conductor Russell Garcia\u2019s original motion picture score to THE TIME MACHINE. The music from George Pal\u2019s Academy Award\u00ae-winning 1960 classic \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d is perhaps composer Russell Garcia\u2019s most well-known work - a thrilling emotionally-charged symphonic score bursting with a sense of wonder and adventure. Now, this beloved music returns in an upgraded remastered edition from the original digital stereo elements that includes several previously unreleased tracks restored as Garcia originally recorded it with the celebrated 60-piece Graunke Symphony Orchestra in Munich, Germany. The bonus Suite from \"Atlantis, The Lost Continent\" Garcia wrote for George Pal\u2019s 1961 production is also included. The CD comes in a jewel case with a 20-page color collectors booklet that features background, photos, and an exclusive interview with Russell Garcia, graphic design by Jim Titus and liner notes by Producer Arnold Leibovit.", "The music is a fantastic mix of dynamism and romanticism that is both beautiful and uplifting. In Garcia\u2019s inspired hands, we can hear the loving themes of Filby and The Time Traveler (their friendship comes alive through the ages), the glorious 'Time Machine' (a mechanism we fully believed could perform the fantastic), and the beautiful and terrifying Wellsian worlds of the Eloi and the Morlocks \u2013 rekindled with a resonance both heartbreaking and unforgettable.", "George Pal\u2019s \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d stands out as perhaps one of the most memorable science fiction feature films of the 1950s. The film starred Rod Taylor as a Victorian scientist (presumably H.G. himself) who invents a machine that hurtles him through time to the far distant future world in the year 802,701. There man has evolved into two species: the gentle surface dwelling Eloi and the beastly Morlocks who live beneath the Earth. Added to this mix were performances by Alan Young as his friend, Filby, Yvette Mimieux as Eloi Weena plus the creation of undoubtedly one of the most iconic props in movie history - The Time Machine itself. All together \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d became a bonafide cinema classic and the one for which George Pal and Russell Garcia will be most remembered.", "Russell Garcia (1916-2011) was a tremendously prolific composer and orchestrator in television and film. His career featured stops at NBC, MGM, and Universal., while his numerous colleagues and collaborators included such luminaries as Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Mel Torm\u00e9, John Williams, Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles, and Walt Disney. His greatest and most inventive work, however, is likely the score he did for \"The Time Machine\" based on the H.G. Wells novel.", "Producer-Director Arnold Leibovit has devoted much of his life to the preservation and promotion of George Pal\u2019s amazing film legacy. To that end, he produced and directed the documentary \u201cThe Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal\u201d and \u201cThe Puppetoon Movie\u201d and its two follow-up releases \u201cThe Puppetoon Movie Volume 2\u201d and \u201cThe Puppetoon Movie Volume 3\u201d currently in production. He also served as Executive Producer for Warner Bros. and DreamWorks\u2019 2002 remake of \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d starring Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons. Leibovit is quite proud and grateful to be able to bring Russell Garcia\u2019s greatest score, from George Pal\u2019s greatest film, back to an eager audience. This sensational limited edition should excite music collectors everywhere.", "FEATURES:", "Language ? : ? English", "Language ? : ?

Release Date March 25, 2010. Format CD. These guys are phenomenal! In the fall of 2007, the YU (Yeshiva University) Acappella Group set out to showcase their university's latent cultural side. Though they didn't yet have their cool name (a play on YU's athletic clubs, the Maccabees) and stood pretty stiffly during their first few performances, these trailblazers cleared the way for the future of the performing arts at Yeshiva University. Committed to the philosophy of Torah u-Madda, the integration of traditional and secular wisdom, the Maccabeats perform an eclectic array of Jewish, American, and Israeli songs. Their trademark piece, arranged by musical director Julian Horowitz, is the epitome of this synthesis, combining some of the most beloved words of Jewish liturgy - Lecha Dodi - with Leonard Cohen's meaningful and melodic Hallelujah. The Maccabeats have performed in venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to Orlando, Florida (and everywhere in between), and are available to enhance a special occasion, or bring a message of Jewish life to your community.. NOTE: No musical instruments were used in the production of this album. Certain sounds were produced using the human voice and may sound like real musical instruments."], "price": 17.45, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414TIxrIzqL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414TIxrIzqL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Yeshiva University A Capella  (Author)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.5 x 5 x 0.3 inches", "Manufacturer": "Sameach Music", "Date First Available": "April 27, 2010", "Label": "Sameach Music"}, "parent_asin": "B003JHVT42", "bought_together": null}

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' 1989 Strange Behaviour tour found the band in somewhat troubled territory promoting what was Petty s acclaimed debut solo album Full Moon Fever, a collaborative effort that involved most of The Heartbreakers and ELO s Jeff Lynne. To add to the discomfort, Petty and Lynne were also cavorting to great success as the Travelling Wilburys with Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and George Harrison. However, The Heartbreakers gave an energetic and charged performance showing that the band were still very much intact and in control, teasing the crowd with a selection of their revered repertoire spanning eight albums and thirteen years of all-American appeal. Their appearance at the Dean Smith Centre on September 13th provided an abundance of hits to satisfy even the most hardened spectator with; Refugee, Breakdown, The Waiting, Don t Come Around Here No More, Free Fallin an acoustic take on Even The Losers and his then current single, I Won t Back Down."], "price": 21.52, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516OgUfsloL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516OgUfsloL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer": "No", "Product Dimensions": "5.5 x 5.5 x 0.25 inches; 2.5 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Klondike", "Item model number": "5291012502216", "Date First Available": "April 11, 2015", "Label": "Klondike", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B00VGN9Q8C", "bought_together": null}

It's a very personal goodbye and a testament to how much John was loved and appreciated by his peers. The project was masterfully coordinated by Rich Rossi, one of John\u2019s closest friends. Rich explains the background of the tribute \u201cJohn\u2019s bass player and close friend Gary Schwartz called me shortly after John\u2019s passing and asked what we were going to do with the recordings John was working on. He suggested asking some of John\u2019s friends to come in and sing for him. And so we did. Their response was incredible. Each artist involved has a personal connection to John. They gave generously of their time and talents, making this album our very own \u2018Thank You\u2019 to the man affectionately known as \u2018Johnny Wicked\u2019.\u201d The project was masterfully produced by Jamie Hoover, and features contributions from John Wicks, Ray Paul, Peter Case, Jamie Hoover, Al Stewart, Chris Thompson (Manfred Mann\u2019s Earth Band), Paul Collins, Don Dixon, Carla Olson, Bill Berry, Kyle Frost, and Nick Guzman!

But if you're familiar with the foibles and idiosyncrasies of church congregations, you'll probably be tempted to think you know exactly who he's singing about. After a lifetime in the church, and 35 years in the ministry, Mariner gives us the real scoop of what the local church is like, singing it like it is. In what sounds like church music he introduces us to: - the decrepit organist, determined to keep going despite advancing age, - the ladies hard at work on the all-consuming annual bazaar, - the Sunday School scholar who's Biblical knowledge is a bit dicey, - preachers who forget how important it is to get the congregation home by noon, and - the congregation gathered for what it does best of all: eating. Mariner's satire includes not only a dig at the preachers out there in \"radioland,\" but also at preachers up there in the pulpit -- of which he is one. Nobody escapes! Irreverent? For sure. (Don't attempt this at home if you're inclined to stuffiness and pomposity.) But in his last song Mariner shows his true colors.

Awaking from the numbing effect of culture and society, to the knowledge and revelation of who Christ is and what He can do through us. I'm truly humbled to see what God has done with a small seed of talent in my life, and I am eager to share these new songs of hope and surrender with the Church.\"Andy has been a worship leader of the second largest church in America, LifeChurch.tv based out of Oklahoma City.

The New Jersey native began playing jazz in Trenton, mentored by jazz great Richie Cole. Petrucelli attended University of Virginia and continued his musical education under the tutelage of John D'Earth. From there he was encouraged by Terence Blanchard to move to New Orleans. The Big Easy proved to be a transformational time for John, he explored composition and deepened his connection to the jazz tradition and expanded his artistic palette. During the summer of 2013, John began an intense slate of performances with his quintet which culminated in his 2015 debut album The Way. Jazz Weekly describes Petrucelli's \"muscular sound on the horn, [having] enthusiastically taken up the serpentine style of soloing patented by Marsh.\" Petrucelli's compelling tunes carry a potent blend of yin and yang that captivates the listener. His newest project, entitled Presence, is dedicated to explorations of the intersections of jazz, electronic and classical music - - Source: Artist PR -- Total Running Time: -- UPC: 888295820431 -- The Amazon ASIN for the mp3 version of this CD is (not known) -- Another listing by Zip"], "price": 18.98, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qxkVyuSsL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61qxkVyuSsL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "John Petrucelli  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.92 x 0.43 inches; 3.49 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "John Petrucelli", "Date First Available": "September 26, 2018", "Label": "John Petrucelli", "Number of discs": "2"}, "parent_asin": "B07HNL2359", "bought_together": null}

Lovecraft's tale of a lingering supernatural horror in a 1930s-style radio drama. Dark Adventure Radio Theatre presents the tale with a huge cast of professional actors, exciting sound effects and thrilling original music by Troy Sterling Nies. Dark Adventure Radio Theatre series: like movies you can enjoy with your eyes closed. A freak storm decimates the population of a remote village in the Catskill Mountains. As the local authorities investigate, they begin to suspect there's more at work than unseasonable weather. Their inquiries lead them to an abandoned mansion from the days when New York was a Dutch colonial territory. Is the old mansion haunted by the victim of a tragic murder? Are strange wild animals roaming the surrounding woods, preying on human victims? Or could there be more terrible forces at work, lurking unseen in the foreboding back woods? The CD edition features the 70 minute audio show plus a collection of props to enhance your listening experience, including: * a map of upstate New York, featuring the Catskill Mountains, Lefferts Corners and other locations of interest * a newspaper account of unspeakable tragedy in a rural mountain village * the gruesome report of the medical examiner * Arthur Munroe's press credentials NEW PACKAGING: Dark Adventure fans may be surprised to see that our CDs now come in a flat cardboard sleeve with a companion binder sleeve for storing props. No more jewel cases. Bigger and better props! You can use your own binder or get our DART Collector's Prop Binder. We think you're going to like it. The show's still complemented by the fantastic artwork of illustrator Darrell Tutchton in the style you've come to know and love from other episodes of Dark Adventure Radio Theatre."], "price": 22.49, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8NqjUJcL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Z8NqjUJcL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-RK6-6jsL._SL1500_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51engl02HpL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51engl02HpL.jpg", "variant": "PT03", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81hGxBGEcRL._SL1425_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51puRC1UyRL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51puRC1UyRL.jpg", "variant": "PT04", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cr8BvAZGL._SL1024_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "H.P.

It was whilst touring with the Travelers in 1958, alongside Sam Cooke, that Lou was involved in a serious car accident, with Lou initially being pronounced dead at the scene and spending more than five days in a coma when he got to hospital. It took many months to fully recover, an event Lou was later to claim life-changing. Upon recovery he switched musical styles and was signed by Capitol in 1962, although his debut album would ultimately appear on the Blue Note label. Backed by the Les McCann Trio, Lou proved himself more than adept at Jazz, producing a stunning debut album. Whilst his later success would come when he turned his attentions more towards R&B and soul (with more than a hint of pop), Stormy Monday has survived the passage of time extremely well, being as delightful a Jazz album now as it was then. It also remains Lou's definitive Jazz album.

The recitation and hearing of the Gayatri, apart from conferring great spiritual merit, leading up to the dawning of the great enlightenment itself, will fulfill one\u2019s cherished desires, ward away diseases and confer longevity. The very water which is charged with the vibrations of the Gayatri mantra cures diseases. The Gayatri has the power to destroy all the evil forces and the effects of sins. It is therefore the essence of all that is sacred in the great Vedas. The Gayatri mantras connected with various deities give particular results and siddhis. The Kali Gayatri addressed to Kali, or Bhavataarini, the redeemer of the universe and the one who helps the aspirant go past the sea of becoming, has the potent effect of conferring health and longevity.

It was another world altogether, even though the war lasted nearly a decade, the grace and valor of the people could not be denied. May be I am a die hard romantic but I cannot help being captivated by those times when even musicians accompanied the armies into the battle field, urging and inspiring the soldiers to venture forth into battle and fight for victory alone. In this day and age when music is played to our solders over the wireless from thousands of miles away, this audio CD, with 22 files or numbers, will help you appreciate that well trained people who made up the Band and went to the war front with only their musical instruments, not guns, just to egg the soldiers on. Performing under fire became commonplace for bands and many performed at the front during battle playing the liveliest airs in their repertory. They too were heroes, though unsung, who helped win the war as General Sheridan rightly remarked while paying tribute to Army bands \"Music has done its share, and more than its share, in winning this war.\""], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01RmK+J4pJL._SS40_.gif", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01RmK+J4pJL.gif", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "American Civil War Band Music  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.97 x 0.54 inches; 2.83 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "A2ZCDS.com", "Date First Available": "November 3, 2006", "Label": "A2ZCDS.com", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B000K9L9F6", "bought_together": null}

The Sitar is of course his chosen instrument, on which he has trained from the tender age of four, practicing all night before flitting away to school in the day. Starting to perform at the age of eight, he found plaudits coming his way from titans like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and his redoubtable uncle Ustad Vilayat Khan, but none from his famous composer father Ustad Aziz Khan, who did not want his son's monumental regimen of riyaaz (practice) to flag through premature praise. He had a lot to learn, considering that he had to assimilate six generations of musical effort of the Etawah Gharana (family musical tradition), even as he mastered the art of making the music flow through his being and making the Sitar sing for him. Shahid Parvez etches the lineaments of the Raga Shyam Kalyan with mellifluous strokes of assurance and poise. The pulsation of gliding notes (meend) and soulful raga phrases take us from the lower ranges to the upper octave. Shahid's approach reveals purity of style and pulchritude of playing. The slow tempo raga delineation preserves the unhurried and languid mood of the raga. The final picture that one gets is not only that of a raga but also that of the masterly style of an introspective musical genius. The unhurried raga essay is followed by acceleration in the melodically denser musical progression consisting of note permutations (calledjhod). Shahid Parvez throws in interesting combinations, contrasts of thick and thin and quivering phrases. In the finale, the artist refers constantly to the drone pitch by strumming the rhythm strings and enters into a phase of rapid pulsation through pluck playing. This is akin to a cloudburst of notes, a shower of musical phrases.

Here are 30 more Elvis classics -- originally recorded in monaural -- that have been converted to brilliant, lifelike STEREO using new, state-of-the-art audio technology called \"DES\" (Digitally Extracted Stereo)! This is a breakthrough development in sound engineering. Never before have Presley fans been able to listen to these great songs with such clarity and detail. The rich tone of Elvis's voice stands out and you hear his backing musicians as if they were all in the room with you! This trend-setting CD is packed with fantastic songs from the 1950s and early '60s, documenting Elvis's repertoire as he helped invent rock 'n' roll. Instead of just another repackaging of the \"same old, same old\" -- presented in one-dimensional mono -- THESE GREAT ELVIS TRACKS COME ALIVE AS NEVER BEFORE IN STEREO! (Purists may argue that mono is better, but how many artists can you name who are recording in mono today?) The first volume of ELVIS REBORN sold out three times so don't let that happen with this one! ORDER TODAY TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A COPY OF THIS GREAT NEW CD -- a true collectible! NOTE: The toxic \"review\" below falsely claiming all the tracks are \"drenched in reverb\" is misleading. This new CD is far removed from the old \"electronically reprocessed\" stereo. \"Elvis Express Radio,\" heard worldwide, has lavished praise on this and the other mono-to-stereo releases by this label.

{"main_category": "Digital Music", "title": "We Have All Been Here Before", "average_rating": 5.0, "rating_number": 2, "features": [], "description": ["Almost a decade ago five musician friends decided to start a band in addition to their long-lasting solo careers because they were convinced it could grow into something big. By now US Rails have established themselves as classic Blue Rose artists, they are about to release their fifth album, We Have All Been Here Before. The album differs quite a bit from its predecessors US Rails (2010), Southern Canon (2011), Heartbreak Superstar (2013) and Ivy (2017). What does a band do when they are about to go on tour and would like to present a new album but do not have enough new songs? Exactly, they look for fitting songs by other songwriters and record a covers album. This approach isn't always successful but the song selections and arrangements by Tom Gillam, Ben Arnold, Scott Bricklin and Matt Muir work like gangbusters! All four of them cherry-picked their songs and interpreted them as if they were original compositions. We Have All Been Here Before contains a delightful mix of well-known and lesser-known gems from rock and pop history. It's legitimate to assume that \"\"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\"\" by Warren Zevon, \"\"So Into You\"\" by the Atlanta Rhythm Section or the old blues number \"\"I'd Rather Be (Blind, Crippled & Crazy)\"\", recently rejuvenated by the Derek Trucks Band, were picked by Tom Gillam - they seem to fit right into his wheelhouse. Ben Arnold sings lead on Neil Young's \"\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\"\" and \"\"Put The Message In The Box\"\" by Karl Wallinger's band World Party - a clear indicator as to who picked these songs. Scott Bricklin is a declared Beatles fan - \"\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\"\" may very well have been his suggestion. Matt Muir is not only a great drummer, he also has a beautiful singing voice that he lends to \"\"Second Hand News\"\" from Fleetwood Mac's classic album Rumours and to album closer \"\"Running On Empty\"\" by Jackson Browne. Each member of US Rails is a great songwriter - they don't have to prove it with every album. We Have All Been Here Before is a beautifully fresh-sounding in-between record to shorten the wait for the next album with original songs."], "price": 32.0, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519oY+5iySL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519oY+5iySL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71s7ZbltKIL._SL1200_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4dZNhdKL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p4dZNhdKL.jpg", "variant": "BACK", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zeXMBPZBL._SL1200_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "US RAILS  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Product Dimensions": "5.47 x 4.92 x 0.28 inches; 1.9 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "BLUE ROSE", "Date First Available": "February 22, 2018", "Label": "BLUE ROSE", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B0791Z1SWB", "bought_together": null}

Lightfoot is widely acknowledged as Canada's greatest and most covered songwriter. Among the countless artists who have recorded his compositions are Harry Belafonte, Blue Rodeo, Glen Campbell, Eva Cassidy, Judy Collins, Bob Dylan, Waylon Jennings, Ian & Sylvia, the Kingston Trio, Mark Lindsay, Johnny Mathis, Nana Mouskouri, Olivia Newton-John, Elvis Presley, Tony Rice, Jeannie C. Riley, Barbra Streisand, Scott Walker, Don Williams and Jesse Winchester. The idea of recording an album of Gordon Lightfoot songs performed by female artists has been percolating for a few years ' a prospect that only made sense considering Bob Dylan's comment, 'Every time I hear a song of his, I wish it would last forever.' Producer Carla Olson decided that the time was right to pursue this concept so she developed a list of artists she thought would be appropriate. While she already knew some of the performers she had in mind, there were some she hadn't previously met. A few of the artists asked for Lightfoot song suggestions but most already had favorites and inquired if the one they wanted to record had been chosen by another.TracksSundown Darling WestCotton Jenny The Kennedys Steel Rail Blues Natalie Noone Summer Side Of Life Shawn Barton VachRiver Of Light Arwen LewisEarly Morning Rain The TextonesIf You Could Read My Mind Susan CowsillThe Way I Feel IIsey JuberBeautiful Ana GazzolaCanadian Railroad Trilogy Katy MoffattCold On The Shoulder Sarah KramerSong For A Winter's Night Kristi Callan Carefree Highway Shayna AlderRingneck Loon Carla Olson", "Tracks Sundown Darling West Cotton Jenny The Kennedys  Steel Rail Blues Natalie Noone  Summer Side Of Life Shawn Barton Vach River Of Light Arwen Lewis Early Morning Rain The Textones If You Could Read My Mind Susan Cowsill The Way I Feel IIsey Juber Beautiful Ana Gazzola Canadian Railroad Trilogy Katy Moffatt Cold On The Shoulder Sarah Kramer Song For A Winter\u2019s Night Kristi Callan  Carefree Highway Shayna Alder Ringneck Loon Carla Olson"], "price": 15.99, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qLcV8ynwL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qLcV8ynwL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XEfsdmkTL._SL1200_.jpg"}, {"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51U9LPW1clL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51U9LPW1clL.jpg", "variant": "PT01", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91lbMl9LJSL._SL1500_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Various Artists  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Product Dimensions": "6.42 x 5.55 x 0.28 inches; 1.69 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Sunset Blvd Records", "Original Release Date": "2021", "Date First Available": "October 1, 2021", "Label": "Sunset Blvd Records", "Country of Origin": "USA", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B09GN7T3YH", "bought_together": null}

Though a number of line-up changes followed, the three original members remained together until September 2010, when drummer Mike Portnoy left the band. Mike Mangini was announced as the new, permanent drummer in April 2011. This 6 CD set captures classic-era Dream Theater while performing live at various junctures in the earlier part of their career, specifically in 1993, 1995 and 1999, with full shows included from each of these years.

L-Pop is a collection of songs and lessons for students learning English at any proficiency level. The songs are catchy and radio-friendly and cover different musical genres, including pop, rock, and country. Best of all, each song targets a particular English grammar issue. For example: When should I use present progressive and simple present? How should I use past perfect? How do I use phrasal verbs, and what are their meanings? L-Pop songs are not grammar lessons by themselves. Instead, the songs provide lots of natural language examples of grammar. Learners of English simply listen to the songs to hear how these tricky structures are used and then complete a listening, writing and speaking lesson that accompanies the song and provides more in-depth practice. L-Pop helps students learn English grammar in a fun, natural way. When you buy L-Pop Volume 1, you receive nine songs, each of which focuses on a different English grammar issue. You may also purchase the L-Pop workbook to accompany the CD. The workbook contains listening, writing and speaking lessons for each song."], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WZeUhAqxL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WZeUhAqxL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81H6QuNMFlL._SL1425_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Patti Spinner and Jon Ritz  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.96 x 0.55 inches; 2.82 Ounces", "Date First Available": "August 12, 2014"}, "parent_asin": "B00MNNNQX0", "bought_together": null}

In 'Finding Sanctuary', Father Christopher Jamison, the Abbot from BBC TV's 'The Monastery', offers practical wisdom from the monastic tradition on how to build sanctuary into your life. In 'The Monastery', the Abbot guided five modern men (and three million viewers) into a new approach to life and this book now offers the reader a similar opportunity. No matter how hard you work, being too busy is not inevitable. Silence and contemplation are not just for monks and nuns, they are natural parts of life. Yet to keep hold of this truth in the rush of modern living you need the support of other people and sensible advice from wise guides. By learning to listen in new ways, people's lives can change and the abbot offers some monastic steps that help this transition to a more spiritual life. In the face of many easy assumptions about the irrelevance of religion today, Father Christopher makes religion accessible for those in search of life's meaning and offers a vision of the world's religions working together as a unique source of hope for the 21st century."], "price": 5.85, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qWoxNnAvL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qWoxNnAvL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Christopher Jamison   Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Language": "English", "Product Dimensions": "5.59 x 0.94 x 4.92 inches; 5.11 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Orion Publishing", "Date First Available": "July 24, 2006", "Label": "Orion Publishing"}, "parent_asin": "0752885537", "bought_together": null}

One review reads 'Hungarian-born Daniel Szabo is an award-winning jazz pianist and an inventive composer whose original compositions often owe as much to the formal classical tradition as they do to the improvisatory spirit of jazz. Szabo, in effect, combines some of the best of both worlds. His writing combines freedom with control\u2014a combination that makes for some very exciting listening.DANIEL_SZABO_DIGIPAK A Song From There, his recently released third album, is a case in point. Fronting a trio featuring bassist Edwin Livingston and drummer Peter Erskine, Szabo takes them on a journey through a varied set of original pieces he acknowledges were influenced by the work of a number of classical sources, specifically his countryman, the world-renowned modernist, Bela Bartok. Whether working with a kind of fantasia on the blues, developing dynamic rhythmic ideas, or acknowledging directly his homage to his influences, the historical context of his musical exploration is clearly evident. This is music that rewards attention. In each of his previous recordings, he had supplemented the trio with a major solo artist\u2014guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel on the 2007 Frictions and saxophonist Chris Potter on the 2010 Contribution.

The organ in the Disney Concert Hall was built by the German organ builder Caspar Glatter-G\u00f6tz under the tonal direction and voicing of Manuel Rosales. The organ has four manuals, 6134 pipes, and its external pipes often referred as \u201cFrench fries.\u201d The major work of the CD is the Sonata on the 94th Psalm by the German composer, Julius Reubke. The organ work is considered as one of the most challenging works in the organ literature. In Track 7 of the CD Dr. Jung-A Lee shows her brilliant technique and exceptional musicianship while playing the 23 minute-long work by Reubke. In organ history Johann Sebastian Bach is considered as the most important composer. His Prelude and Fugue in G major, BWV 541, was recorded as Track 4 of the CD. Her playing is very delicate and expresses the characteristics of the Baroque era very well. A couple of hymn arrangements were recorded as tracks 1 and 3. On purpose I chose the opening track to be a well-known melody, \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d so that people can feel close to organ music. A former organist, Christopher Pardini, wrote a great rendition on the worldly renown tune. Another hymn arrangement is based on, \u201cSavior, Again to Thy Dear Name We Raise.\u201d Dr. Edwin Willmington, who is the dean of Fred Bock Institute of Music, Fuller Seminary, wrote a beautiful work. Daniel\u2019s Prayer by Corneliu Mootz is a very unique organ work, as it almost reminds me of a movie theme. Even though the composer had the Bible verses in mind, one will be able to appreciate this amazing organ piece as it brings out so many different colors from the huge organ at Disney Hall."], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519v0mvro7L._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519v0mvro7L.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y16rJcTvL._SL1379_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Jung-A Lee  (Artist),     Julius Reubke  (Composer),     Massimo Nosetti  (Composer),     Edwin M.

Toho Sara is a weird unit that attempts to achieve a mystic fusion of ethnic music and rock, according to their own unique methodology. Toho Sara creates a strange musical aura where the vibrations of folk instruments from around the world and electronics merge weirdly. These bizarre recordings enbrace musical shamanism on the one hand, and a subversion of western musical concepts into the abyss of rock on the other. Toho Sara is here at their most mystic side.

The album featured significant developments in heavy metal technique, in particular its use of double-kick drumming on tracks such as Dissident Aggressor , and includes a pop-metal cover of Diamonds & Rust by folk singer Joan Baez. Sin After Sin appeared in April 1977 on CBS, and was the first of eleven consecutive albums to be certified Gold or higher by the RIAA. Priest then recorded 1978's Stained Class, produced by Dennis MacKay, and Killing Machine (released in America as Hell Bent for Leather). In 1980, the band released British Steel. The songs were shorter and had more mainstream radio hooks, but retained the familiar heavy metal feel. By this time Juda Priest were considered godfathers of the then-emerging New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. Their 1982 album Screaming for Vengeance featured You've Got Another Thing Comin', which became a major radio hit in the US. The album went Double Platinum. On 29 May 1983, the band played on Heavy Metal Day of the US Festival, a music festival in San Bernardino, California sponsored by Steve Wozniak. The band was fourth in the line-up that also included Quiet Riot, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Ozzy Osbourne, Triumph, Scorpions, and Van Halen. During the same tour, Priest performed at Houston, Texas s Convention Center, on 8th June, playing a show that was recorded for live FM broadcast, and synched across the US. The band put on a quite stunning show which is still hailed as the best of the tour to this day. Previously unreleased, this complete broadcast recording is now available for the first time on this new CD. 1. Heading Out to the Highway 4:17 2. Desert Plains 5:53 3. Devil's Child 4:41 4.

With touch points ranging from ambient to minimalist counterpoint, its spatial atmospheres and chiaroscuro textures stun, lull and amaze. Includes guest appearances by Pat Mastelotto (percussion) and Jeff Gauthier (violin). Produced by Ronan Chris Murphy. Track Listing: 1. Adamantine 2. Years Between The Great Wars 3. And Time Passed, Imperceptibly 4. We Are Dealing With Uncertainty 5. The Wide Sea , An Untamed Shore 6. The High Is Built By The Low 7. Mourning Doves 8. The Stream Of Our Life Forth is best known for his work with the modern progressive rock band, Ten Seconds. A duo comprised of Forth and composer/keyboardist/drummer Jeffrey Fayman, Ten Seconds released their eponymous debut album on Robert Fripp's Discipline Global Mobile label in 1996. Forth & Fayman's music has appeared in a wide range of media, from The Super Bowl to several movie trailers. Forth also is member of the ambient duo, Lives of the Saints, which includes Ronan Chris Murphy. In its review of Destroying Silence - An Introduction to Veneto West Records, L.A. Weekly commented that \"Lives of the Saints hammers rusty nails into Eno ambient.\" In 2009, Forth appeared on Pomiedzy Cieniami (In Between the Shadows) a Polish release produced in collaboration with composer Radek Kordasiewicz, with poetry by Kasia Sokolowska.

Refusing the traditional move to Los Angeles to join their peers on the Sunset Strip, this band focused on the Mid-West, and built up a loyal fanbase. Their first album entitled \"Abusement Park\" was released in 1993 and it established the band as a driving force in energetic rock music. The band received critical acclaim both in the states and throughout Europe for their debut release. They went fromfrontpage on a variety of underground Rock fanzines, to being featured in numerous national and international magazines, and to being called \"America's brightest hope\" on MTV Europe Headbanger's Ball. EROTIC SUICIDE is a band that built their energy from their passion and love for music. Whether playing live or in the studio, each member of this band surrenders every ounce of himself to the music in which he is playing. Shortly after its release the band began playing shows to support \"Abusement Park\" playing with such acts as Ugly Kid Joe, Jackyl, Ace Frehley, Bang Tango, and Vince Neil. Shortly thereafter, the band shot a video for their first release \"Can't Remember.\" Eventually, EROTIC SUICIDE was signed to the German label Koch Records which re-mastered and released Abusement Park. In total about 25,000 copies of Abusement Park were sold in the US and abroad. While touring in support of Abusement Park, the band began writing material for their second album which was slated to be called \"To Die For.\" Ultimately the band parted ways with their label and went back to their roots, changing the name of the album to Perseverance and releasing it themselves.

Deep Sleep employs the same high quality production techniques as Simply Sleep, but has been made with the needs of the more analytical, inquisitive, or 'close', listener in mind, although it can be equally enjoyed, and equally effective for anyone. Deep Sleep still features Alan's reassuring voice, and uses echo tracks to great effect, at times using them to cascade over the listener's attention, all perfectly audible, but overflowing in a way which forbids careful examination of each word. There are more open spaces on Deep Sleep than before, and the scripted parts of dialogue largely avoid being unduly descriptive until the recording is well established, to prevent the sort of critical scrutiny that can allow attention to remain vigilant, which of course prevents sleep. Successful use of this recording will be best achieved by listening on a regular, preferably nightly, basis, as you are ready to go to sleep, preferably on comfortable headphones, once the lights are out. When you find your attention wandering from the recording content then that's great, and if it doesn't then it almost certainly will, in the end, so accept your best and be patient. Ultimately, by definition, it will be while your attention is distracted that your body and unconscious brain will step in to establish sleep, and you needn't (shouldn't!) know a thing about it. Remember-letting sleep in isn't about giving up control, it's about staying in it!"], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YZzYUESWL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51YZzYUESWL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Alan Wick  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.97 x 0.54 inches; 2.83 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Promodisc", "Date First Available": "December 10, 2013", "Label": "Promodisc", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B006JJWSK6", "bought_together": null}

The fourteen track album includes 'Lasciatemi morire,' the only surviving remnant of the opera Arianna, written by Claudio Monteverdi in 1608, and recognized as opera's first hit. Another highlight is Delizie Contente from Giasone, the most popular opera of the 17th century, written by Francesco Cavalli in 1649. After their initial success, many of the arias on Tesori fell out of favor as opera evolved and tastes changed. These pieces would have been lost forever if not for the detective work of Alessandro Parisotti, who unearthed, rearranged and published them in the 19th century.

Although too ill to stand, Jennings is in fine--even exceptional--voice, as he and his Waymore Blues Band, augmented with horns for the first time, cruise through a tight and tough two-hour gig. This 2007 expanded edition of Jennings's final album not only adds eight tracks and a second audio disc, but also throws in a professionally shot DVD remixed in crystal-clear 5.1 surround sound. Guests Travis Tritt, Montgomery Gentry, and John Anderson add cameos, along with Waylon's wife Jessi Colter, who appears on four tracks. But this is Jennings's show, and although the country legend's health was on a downslide from which he would never recover, he sounds inspired and vital throughout this set of hits (and some obscurities). Extra tracks such as Tony Joe White's \"Trouble Man\" and the Band's \"The Weight\" are terrific additions, and the disc has now been reconfigured to follow the original sequence. Fans might lament the omission of signature Waylon fare such as \"Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line\" and \"Lonesome, On'ry and Mean\" and the inclusion of fluffier pop like \"Never Been to Spain,\" but this remains a moving and exciting live recording. The DVD is an indispensable bonus. It shows Jennings's obvious delight playing with this exceptional 11-piece outfit and their enthusiasm working with a country legend. The package is a fitting final document to one of roots music's most edgy trailblazers and essential listening/viewing for any country fan.", "--Hal Horowitz"], "price": 29.98, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OU18q5hjL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OU18q5hjL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QZbD469YL._SL1500_.jpg"}], "videos": [], "store": "Waylon Jennings   Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Language": "English", "Product Dimensions": "4.94 x 5.58 x 0.38 inches; 3.04 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Legacy Recordings", "Item model number": "3356577", "Original Release Date": "2007", "Run time": "5 hours and 58 minutes", "Date First Available": "June 19, 2007", "Label": "Legacy Recordings", "Number of discs": "3"}, "parent_asin": "B000S6LSXE", "bought_together": null}

The period prior to the concert had been a busy time for Neil Young. He and Crazy Horse had produced the sombre Sleeps With Angels in 1994, dedicated to Kurt Cobain, who had committed suicide earlier that year. This was followed in June 1995 by Young s collaboration with Pearl Jam, Mirror Ball, and in 95 too, Young was also recording the instrumental soundtrack for Jim Jarmusch s black and white western Dead Man, which saw general release on 10th May 1996. Young performed most of the Cardinal Stadium concert with minimal backing, accompanied only by Willie Nelson on guitar and Mickey Raphael on harmonica, and played a set that included numbers from across the man s career, although with emphasis on his 1970s output. Crazy Horse joined him for the two-track encore however, providing a full scale rock-out on which to complete proceedings for another year.

Following the tragic death of bassist Cliff Burton in a bus crash near Drarp, Sweden, on 27th September, many believed the band would break-up. However, with the blessing of Burton s family, Metallica soldiered on, enlisting Jason Newsted as his replacement. More impressively, the band resumed touring again just over a month after the tragedy, playing the Country Club in Reseda, California on 8th November. Although they had been forced to cancel a number of dates in the meantime, the group continued with the remainder of the Damage Inc. Tour. Playing more than 50 further shows across North America, Asia and Europe, they concluded on 13th February 1987 with a performance at the Frlundaborg in Gothenburg, just 100 miles from the crash site. Newsted s first recordings with the band would follow in August 1987, with the release of the covers record, The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited. The show included on this CD is taken from the Canadian leg of the Damage Inc. Tour, during Newsted s first jaunt with the band. Recorded at Pantages Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg on 13th December, and broadcast in exceptional audio quality over FM radio, this performance finds Metallica displaying as much fury and energy as ever they had, in a performance that exemplifies the band s commitment to the future."], "price": 10.79, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-0TDvSSkL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-0TDvSSkL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "METALLICA  (Artist)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Product Dimensions": "5.59 x 4.92 x 0.47 inches; 3.25 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "ZIP CITY", "Date First Available": "November 29, 2016", "Label": "ZIP CITY", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B01LXYDR98", "bought_together": null}

He spent February and March rehearsing a band that dispensed with keyboardist Peter Wolf, but saw the return of guitarists Ray White and Ike Willis, pianist Tommy Mars and bassist Arthur Barrow. David Logeman was bought in on drums, replacing Vinnie Colaiuta. Starting with a gig at the Seattle Center Arena on 25th March, the Zappa band spent much of 1980 on the road. They played 26 shows in the US between late March and early May, then, after a 10-day break, they set off for Europe for another 34 dates. The show featured on this CD was recorded for live FM broadcast at Munich s Olympiahalle on 3rd July, the group s final European date and the end of a 15 date run in Germany - at the time home to Zappa s most fervent fan base. Transmitted too, via live sync, across the USA, this dynamic performance remains one of Zappa s finest gigs of the era.

Their recordings continue to place this nationally touring trio among the most-played artists on international acoustic radio. Washingtonian magazine said 'Insiders expect the... trio Hot Soup to go far!' The Mars 'Spirit' Rover Digs Hot Soup! NASA's press release read, in part: 'Spirit Digs a Trench\" 'On sol 47, ending at 12:36 p.m. February 20, 2004 PST, engineers woke 'Spirit' up to the song 'Dig Down Deep,' by Hot Soup [written by Libby Roderick], and that's exactly what Spirit proceeded to do. The two-hour operation performed by Spirit's left front wheel resulted in a trench 7-8 centimeters deep (2.8 to 3.1 inches) that uncovers fresh soil and possibly ancient information....' Afterwards, the JPL Mission Manager told the trio that he found their music by searching on iTunes: 'The voices, harmony, and rhythm were simply captivating with this soul-penetrating crystalline clarity, and the lyrics were so appropriate, it was freaky. We were going to do our first digging operation with the Spirit rover (making a trench with the wheels) to look under the surface for possible evidence of liquid water having been there at one time... to determine whether Mars may have once had an environment suitable for life.... Essentially, we're looking for Hot Soup.' Mark Adler, Mars Exploration Rover Spirit Mission Manager Look no further! Hot Soup's live shows 'sparkle,' said Sing Out! Magazine. The trio brings a rare blend of spontaneity and intimacy to their performances, often developing hilarious exchanges among themselves and with the audience. The trio's musical diversity extends to their instrumentation, including a variety of guitar stylings, harp, conga, ubang (a variety of udu), and small percussion such as kokirico and window shutter. The focus, however, is always the sweet voices, trading lead vocals and capturing harmonies that raise goose bumps. No surprise, really. All three are talented solo performers with recordings of their own in addition to 'Hot Soup!', 'Soup Happens,' and their latest release 'The Way You Like It'. Sue Trainor is best known for satirical humor in her adult shows and imaginative musical play in her children's performances; her children's music CD Under Tables, Out Back Doors won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum award. Christina Muir, the daughter of Ann Mayo Muir (of Bok, Muir and Trickett), builds on her musical heritage with her elegant vocals and lyrical instrumentation, insightful contemporary songwriting, and engaging repartee. Hot Soup's newest member, Jennie Avila, brings her magnetic stage presence, agile soprano, flavorful original songs, exotic birdcalls and groove-full percussion to create an irresistible blend. 'Mix the tight, intricate harmonies of the Hills, Herdman, Mangsen trio with the stylistic variety of the Four Bitchin' Babes, then add the zaniness and energy of the Chenille Sisters. You've just made HOT SOUP!'

The band's headlining concert on June 26th is now available as a 2-CD set DMB pulled some great stuff out of their trick bag on the last night in AC with rarity (and previously unreleased) Kill the King, Seek Up into Warehouse, Dive In featuring a new musical intro and a first for the band with a cover of Sweet Emotion. The crowd went wild during the quadruple encore when DMB began playing Halloween after Carter's snare drum intro to Ants Marching, launching back into Ants at the end of Halloween. DMB ended the show and an incredible weekend of music with the apropos Thank You Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Agin. The fans continued chanting the song as they exited the Caravan and walked over the bridge to the boardwalk. Disc 1 1. Seek Up 2. Warehouse 3. What Would You Say 4. Kill The King 5. Granny 6.

The CDs are professionally recorded and produced. Gilana Sutta: According to the Samyutta Nikaya, once when the Buddha was gravely ill he asked Venerable Mahacunda to recite the seven Factors of Enlightenment to him. In such a way the Buddha was cured of his illness. In the Pali literature, these short verses are recommended by the Buddha as providing protection from certain afflictions. The belief in the effective power to heal, or protect, of the saccakiriya, or asseveration of something quite true is an aspect of the work ascribed to the paritta. This paritta is recited from SN 46.16 (Gilana Sutta III) Mahacunda Thera Bojjhanga (\"Elder Maha Cunda's Factors of Awakening\"). This recording brings positive healing vibration.

If connected with optical cables it will only deliver 5.1 or 6.1 standard DTS quality sound. For the purpose of this review I only used high-speed 1.3 cables connecting the Blu-ray player and the 7.2 AV receiver. I should mention that the present receiver is one of Onkyo s new generation of THX-certified products built around high quality Burr-Brown DACs. The DTS-HD MA encoding of this recording as connected with 1.3 HDMI cables produces a variable bit rate (VBR), bit-for-bit (lossless) stream that includes 7.1 channels with sample rates of 96 kHz. Just as well the DTS-HD MA-encoded files also contain a backward-compatible DTS Digital Surround 5.1 (and 6.1) core with a bit rate of 1509 kbps. However, this review concerns itself only with 7.1 DTS-HD MA channels reproduction. The unique acoustic reality experience that his recording affords to my ears as to the musical phrasing and playing of these two very complex scorings, the orchestral presence, instrumental sections separation, high and low dynamics and instrumental solos are far superior to anything I have heard on so-called true surround recordings. We are placed at the same location that the conductor assumes in the podium, we are not part of the audience - we hear what the conductor hears. Orchestral sound is very close and all around, especially the sound coming out of the two side-surround speakers. In my mind the use of these side speakers totally redefines surround sound; this is a new experience and something to behold. --Audiophile Audition Review"], "price": null, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JH0lDNLfL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JH0lDNLfL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Surround Records International Collaboration of Performers  (Performer),     Alexander Golberg Jero  (Performer)    Format: Blu-ray Audio", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "7.1 x 5.42 x 0.58 inches; 2.93 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Blu-ray Music", "Run time": "1 hour and 2 minutes", "Date First Available": "May 31, 2013", "Label": "Blu-ray Music", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B00D3SX9WW", "bought_together": null}

In 1984, EMI published a considerably more interesting highlights disc called \"Here's a How-De-Do\" featuring Tear, Sheila Armstrong and Benjamin Luxon. Robert Tear is the common denominator between the two discs, and I find him unpersuasive: his interpretation is a bit too precious; he lacks the swagger I expect in a G&S tenor. The remaining performers are all excellent, and the second disc has the additional virtue of presenting a number of items not often heard on records, particularly two items from Haddon Hall.

Something happened between 1979 and 1981. Petra's 4th album Never Say Die took a turn to very AOR/Def Leppard-ish like approach compared to the Air Supply approach of Washes Whiter Than, dropping rockers like \u201cChameleon,\u201d \u201cAngel of Light,\u201d \u201cWithout Him We Can Do Nothing,\u201d \u201cFather of Lights\u201d and \u201cPraise Ye the Lord.\u201d It became very clear that this band was headed for Christian Arena-Rock Stardom, leaving the classic mellower style behind and forging a new path towards 80's epic Christian rock band status and success that few bands enjoyed. You'll understand after listening to it how Petra went from hand to mouth to become Christian Music's first stadium rock band and indeed the genre's first supergroup putting on a show like Styx or Kansas traveling with a stage set-up that required 3 semi-trucks. This album is the all-out assault on the forces of darkness. Yes, it was militant like, and yes we all officially enlisted in God\u2019s army after hearing it. From the graphics to the lyrics, to the stage set-up, Petra officially waged war on the enemy but also on the complacency of a Christian band that just wanted to rock, and rock they did. Only getting better with each and every album. The fact that this album was never on a CD alone by itself rather than on a 1988 double album with Washes Whiter Than surprises many to this day. Thankfully it's now been remastered (and reloaded). Never Say Die is finally on a stand-alone CD complete with trading card and an 8-page booklet with lyrics and photos in a jewel case. Arena rock never sounded or looked better."], "price": 25.0, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nGvBEOxoL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nGvBEOxoL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Petra  (Contributor)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "9.17 x 4.84 x 0.39 inches; 3.21 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Petra", "Run time": "50 minutes", "Date First Available": "December 11, 2021", "Label": "Petra"}, "parent_asin": "B09NGN3295", "bought_together": null}

The show ran for 13 episodes on ABC in 1946, for 157 episodes on CBS in 1946-1949, and finally for 51 episodes on NBC in 1949-1951. The series starred Howard Duff (and later, Steve Dunne) as Sam Spade and Lurene Tuttle as his secretary Effie, and took a considerably more tongue-in-cheek approach to the character than the novel or movie. The series was largely overseen by producer/director William Spier. In 1947, scriptwriters Jason James and Bob Tallman received an Edgar Award for Best Radio Drama from the Mystery Writers of America. Before the series, Sam Spade had been played in radio adaptations of The Maltese Falcon by both Edward G. Robinson (in a 1943 Lux Radio Theater production) and by Bogart himself (in a 1946 Academy Award Theater production), both on CBS.

Eight years later would come another wild, weird and wacky movie called Tormented, made by the wonderful Bert I. Gordon. It was a story of death and jazz and love and a nasty female ghost come back to haunt and torment. The cast included Richard Carlson, Juli Reding, Lugene Sanders, and the adorable Susan Gordon (Bert\u2019s daughter). Also making an appearance is Joe Turkel, who did several films for Gordon and who would ultimately give his most memorable performance as bartender Lloyd in the Stanley Kubrick film, The Shining. Naturally, the perfect person to score these films was Albert Glasser, and he delivered exactly what was expected of him and which no other composer could have delivered in quite the same way. For Invasion USA he created a blaring, driving, crazy-quilt of a score, with screaming, dissonant brass. One simply cannot imagine a more perfect score for the movie. For Tormented, since the film\u2019s leading man is a jazz pianist, Glasser naturally wrote a jazzy score \u2013 but this is not your normal jazz, this is TORMENTED jazz \u2013 jagged and crazy and somehow perfectly capturing the visuals of the film. The two scores were mastered from Mr. Glasser\u2019s personal tapes. While there are occasional sound issues, our wonderful mastering engineer, James Nelson, has done Herculean work to make both scores sound as good as they\u2019re ever going to."], "price": 19.95, "images": [{"thumb": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51t7kZqP9LL._SS40_.jpg", "large": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51t7kZqP9LL.jpg", "variant": "MAIN", "hi_res": null}], "videos": [], "store": "Albert Glasser  (Composer, Conductor)    Format: Audio CD", "categories": [], "details": {"Package Dimensions": "5.55 x 4.97 x 0.54 inches; 2.83 Ounces", "Manufacturer": "Kritzerland", "Date First Available": "March 20, 2012", "Label": "Kritzerland", "Number of discs": "1"}, "parent_asin": "B007MQY8IA", "bought_together": null}

The opus 1 recorded here was the very first collection of Italian music ever published in France. For a long time the French resisted the Italian influence which had become so dominant elsewhere in Europe. But around 1700 more and more composers began to absorb elements of the Italian style. The fact that an Italian like Mascitti was not only accepted but even highly praised tells us much about the change in the cultural climate at the time.  Mascitti was born in Chieti, near Naples, and began his career in the royal chapel, where his uncle - who also was his first teacher in music - acted as violinist. After travelling through Europe he settled in Paris, where he came under the patronage of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. The duke was an ardent lover of Italian music and Mascitti was just one of the Italian musicians he took under his wing. This connection allowed Mascitti to play at the royal court in Paris. He made such an impression that in 1714 he was granted a king's privilege to print for 15 years 'collections of sonatas and other musical pieces, vocal as well as instrumental'. This privilege was twice extended, in 1731 and 1740, and - as a sign of the appreciation of Mascitti - he was given French citizenship in 1739. It seems he was also generally liked as a person, because of his friendly character and his generosity. Mascitti died in Paris at a venerable age in 1760.", "Mascitti's music was appreciated although he didn't make any real concessions to the French taste. These sonatas opus 1 are predominantly Italian in character, and it is no wonder that they were compared with the sonatas of Arcangelo Corelli. Like Corelli Mascitti uses both the common forms of the sonata, the 'sonata da camera' and the 'sonata da chiesa'. But there are also some sonatas in this collection which are a mixture of both forms, like the Sonata II which contains five movements: adagio, allegro, largo (sonata da chiesa), allemande and giga (sonata da camera). The twelve sonatas are divided into two groups: six for violin and b.c. and six for two violins with basso continuo. In three of the trio sonatas the cello is given some independence. In those cases the viola da gamba joins the harpsichord in the realisation of the basso continuo part.  These discs offer more than 100 minutes of music and it was no problem at all to listen to them in a single session; there's not a dull moment. I was struck by the quality of this music, and in particular by the variety and originality of the thematic material. These sonatas have enough to offer to keep the listener's attention, like the expression in the slow movements. A striking example is the first movement of the Sonata V, whose character is indicated with 'largo et affectuoso'. In particular in the trio sonatas there are a number of movements which contain strong harmonic tension. In the grave of the Sonata VII there is some chromaticism as well. The solo sonatas are not overly virtuosic, although several movements contain double-stopping. Mascitti's opus 1 is definitely more than easy-listening stuff.  It is to the credit of Ensemble Baroques-Graffiti that this set of discs rapidly becomes quite captivating and enjoyable. The fast movements are performed with panache and great rhythmic flexibility. The expressive moments in the slower movements are also fully explored. Sometimes the playing is a bit less polished than we are used to hear from the best ensembles in the business - especially in some of the solo sonatas - but that did not in any way spoil my enjoyment and appreciation. The basso continuo section gives both harmonic and strong rhythmic support. Interestingly the basso continuo of the Sonata X is played by cello only -[more] ...
