## Reflection and Self Assessment


I encountered several issues during the development and testing of this program. One challenge was a recurring "std::out_of_range" error, which came from mistakenly using an '&' sign in one of my private class variables. This error consumed a large amount of my time to identify . However, through careful debugging and assistance from office hours, I was able to pinpoint and correct this issue.

Another challenge I faced was understanding and implementing the correct logic for filtering businesses based on user input (zipcode and categories). I had to use specific string manipulation functions to extract relevant information from the JSON file. Additionally, I had to ensure that the program correctly matched categories and zip codes, which required thorough testing and debugging.

One aspect that "clicked" for me during this assignment was the importance of proper error handling . Implementing a message to inform the user when no results were found helped clarify the errors unexpected scenarios.
