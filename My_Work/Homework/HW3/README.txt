## Reflection and Self Assessment

During the development and testing of this assignment, I encountered several memory issues, syntax errors  and learned valuable lessons. The main issues and learnings include:

- **Code Adaptation:** Adapting the provided code from a ride-sharing system to a movie and TV show recommendation system needed careful consideration and modification.

- **Understanding Matrix Input:** Understanding how the input matrices were formatted and processed was crucial for correctly implementing the recommendation algorithm.

- **File Handling:** Ensuring proper file handling for both input and output files was essential. I encountered challenges in correctly reading and writing data from/to files.

- **Memory Management:** Managing memory allocation and deallocation for matrices and arrays was critical for preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient program execution.

- **Algorithm Implementation:** Implementing the recommendation algorithm based on user ratings posed challenges in terms of logic and algorithm design. It required a clear understanding of the recommendation system's objectives and constraints.

- **Testing and Debugging:** Thorough testing and debugging were necessary to ensure the correctness and robustness of the implemented solution. I encountered several bugs and errors during testing, which required careful debugging and correction.

Overall, despite the challenges encountered, I found the assignment rewarding as it provided valuable insights into implementing recommendation systems and reinforced my understanding of key programming concepts.
