Loop through the json file and create an object 
Put these objects in a B+ Tree
Use Range search to search for the products in the price range . 
For all products that fall into that price range, sort them based on the rating in a descending order - products with a higher rating being displayed first. 
If there is a tie, break the tie by prices - products with a lower price being displayed first. If there is still a tie, i.e. two products have the same rating, and have the same price, break the tie by comparing the title of the products, i.e., apply the less than operator (<) to the two titles - both are std::strings, the product whose title is less than the title of the other product should be displayed first.â€™



For sorting 
        if (rating != other.rating)
            return rating > other.rating;
        if (price != other.price)
            return price < other.price;
        return title < other.title;
