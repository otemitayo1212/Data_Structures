## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I encountered several challenges throughout the development and testing phases of this assignment. 
Various issues arose, ranging from syntax errors to the search for suitable functions within the code.
 One particularly challenging aspect was dealing with vector functions and navigating through string files. 
 Despite these difficulties, I managed to address the issues by conducting research and learning independently. 
 The development and testing process presented a learning curve, 
 but eventually, I gained a better understanding of certain concepts that "clicked" for me during the assignment.
